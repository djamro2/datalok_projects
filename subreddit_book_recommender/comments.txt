The Vue.js examples page has a markdown editor very similar to this one. 
I was playing around with Vue.js and I always wanted to use a really clean markdown web editor, so I built this. It's the first user oriented app I've built and any feedback would be appreciated.
He nice, I build something similar with angular2 recently:
https://kasperpeulen.github.io/mathedit/#/gist/2a765ba07e26493c7716

Awesome. Tab support?
I just updated it to add Github Flavoured Markdown, HTML export, syntax highlighting, emoji support and more. Would appreciate any feedback
Yep, as I mentioned in [my medium article](https://medium.com/@SnazzyHam/why-i-built-simpledown-750e5663bb1f), it was messing around with the Vue.js docs where I found that example and noticed that it was everything I wanted out of a markdown editor, a simple, barebones thing where I didn't have to login to use it. If only it was hosted on its own domain or whatever and easier to access, so that's what I did. It's not meant to be like a big product or anything, just a simple tool that I thought others might benefit from.. 
How about [Markdown Notes](http://markdownnotes.com)? It's [open source](https://github.com/nicbou/markdown-notes) and has a few nice extras.

By the way, what did you think of Vue.js?
Whoa dude, this is pretty cool. I personally don't do math that often but I've got a few friends that do and I've sent them this link
Tab support has been added, along with a lot of improvements! 
Will add that to the list of upcoming features! 
I have been building a site for myself in my spare time and I wanted to use a markdown editor for my blog section I ended up using [this](https://github.com/NextStepWebs/simplemde-markdown-editor) and integrating it with Vue.js. Its going pretty well so far. 
Markdown notes is cool, but you still have to login to use it, which is one of the steps I don't want to have to go through everytime I log in to a computer in the lab at my university. 

Also, Vue is pretty cool, it has a slight learning curve and I'm still trying to get a hang of it, but i'm excited to continue learning. I'll be sharing my experiences with Vue periodically [over on my blog](http://blog.snazzyham.com) 
Awesome! Nice work on this. Just tweeted it from our account
Wow, that looks really nice. I'm going to read up a little on it and might just replace 'Marked', which is what I'm currently using, with this. Any idea if the preview section can be moved to it's own window that appears next to it, or does it have to be a toggle?
Thanks a bunch! Really means a lot!

I would not recommend using a new client project to learn a stack that you are not familiar with unless of course you make them aware of this fact. 

You will inevitably make more mistake using a framework you don't know than one that you are familiar with. 

Unless there is some feature of the MEAN stack that you must have that is not provided by RoR, do yourself and your client a favor and use what you know. 

I think it's completely logical/moral to learn new things on new projects, but not entire frameworks or core pieces from scratch, especially if they will drastically affect the cost/timing to your customer. 

I would learn the MEAN stack on your own time before introducing it into your client's projects. 

Idk how much you're getting paid for this, but I would think using an ecommerce CMS would be the most time efficient and thus most profitable method.
Also, I would use Postgres over Mongo for anything e-commerce. An e-commerce platform, even if you aren't managing payments yourself, is just too sensitive to things like race conditions. Transactions and normalization are a saving grace.

Finally, yeah, a client's e-commerce solution seems like the worst place to be learning a new stack.

This is excellent advice, thank you. I'll build it in Rails. 
Great feedback, thanks
Use Browser Sync with Gulp, no idea how I ever lived without it.  If anyone reading this isn't using something like browser-sync they need to be.
I got Browser Sync up and running yesterday and it is fantastic!
I had the same "how I lived without it" epiphany. 
Did you update the version in the primary php file with the php comment at the top as well?
That was it. Thank you for pointing that out. 
Welcome. It's bit me a couple times in the past as well.
I Shared this because I found it very interesting. I would imagine in the future this application would be split into several smaller special purpose applications, or an application stack / ecosystem.

As someone who writes really tiny parts of programs in C already, but mainly uses Python and PHP. I found this incredibly interesting, and wanted to share to get others opinions.
A very good read
Thus far, I've found the answer for the clientside to be: "you don't".

On the backend, you could use [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/screen-capture.html) to convert an HTML file to PDF. 
Check out http://wkhtmltopdf.org/
Just use wkhtml. It is powered by an older webkit build, so you get a decent layout engine.
The best solution out there if you are dealing with complex and large documents is [PrinceXML](http://www.princexml.com) by far. It costs a fortune for a server license, but if you want an extremely well supported and reliable solution, this is it. The SaaS version is [DocRaptor](https://docraptor.com) but that's far too costly imho.

We tried everything else, starting with the usuals you see in the other posts here and also iText. They are good enough for basic PDF layouts, but once you get into large and complex documents, they all fail miserably. iText fared a bit better, but Prince won in terms of usability.
What server side language are you running? If node, you might look at this node module? https://www.npmjs.com/package/html-pdf 
 https://github.com/dompdf/dompdf

But it sucks when using large tables. And the development seems to have kinda stalled. 
I've used http://www.tcpdf.org/ in many PHP projects for converting HTML to PDF.
Have briefly looked at it, will try again. Thanks.
[DocRaptor](https://docraptor.com) developer here. We have many clients using Angular. While DocRaptor, as masqita mentioned, isn't the cheapest solution (I'd argue we're very affordable though), our support team will actively help you debug any Angular or HTML to PDF issues, including display issues.
I'm using Godaddy as host, and as I understand, they do not support Node.
I still have nightmares from having to use TCPDF in different ecommerce systems.

wkhtmltopdf / phantomjs are a much more pleasant experience IMO and there are PHP libraries available, too.
I should have been clearer: for the application I was working on DocRaptor would have become more expensive than PrinceXML in the long run.

The users of the app basically generated PDFs all day for just about everything you can imagine (quotes, order confirmation, price requests, reports, invoices, …), small one-to-two page documents, large briefings but lots and lots of them. They had a need for just about everything you can think of in print: multicolumn, SVG support, footnotes, … and they wanted something a web dev could use.

I don't remember the exact tipping point, but it was somewhere in the 16-24 month range iirc. It's been a while though, and I'm fairly certain PrinceXML back then was cheaper than it is now for a single server license (we're talking about the PrinceXML 7 or early 8 days). They made the choice to go for a Prince license and run it on their own hardware (and were extremely happy with it).

Using a SaaS solution like DocRaptor of course has its advantages: cost scales with usage, updates are included in the price and you'll probably get away with less beefy hardware to run your app on.
A Records are different from MX records

In simple words:

MX = mail exchange records

A = for pointing domains/subdomains to a server usually for hosting purposes.

As long as the DNS is pointing to GoDaddy, and if you change the above records, all should be good.

Just note that once you change the MX records, it may take a while for all the ISPs to update them and some emails may end up in old email server. Usually changes are reflected within an hour or so but can take up to 48 hours. 

But if you have access to both email servers, you wont lose any email.

Hope this answers your question.

edit: Depending on how your currently setup is, you can also forward any incoming email to your old server to your new server. This is something you will have to research or provide us with more info for any support.
Shouldn't – however one thing that might be worth checking is that their configuration for their email clients aren't dependent on any CNAME records (e.g. mail.theirdomainname.com) instead of the "direct" address of the email servers. Had an issue with a client a while ago whose email stopped working because his email client was configured to use the CNAME values on his own domain instead of the direct ones for the server. It's a pretty unlikely scenario most of the time, but can't hurt to check.
Thank you very much for your help and explanation.

Because of the possible timeframe, we plan to do the move this weekend when it is likely to be less busy. Then we can keep an eye on Outlook to get any emails from the old server and export them once they are across to Zoho. 

One thing I didn't mention in my original post is that I have put together a simple Wordpress site for them which is what the A Small Orange hosting is for. So I guess my confusion is about how to point the records in two different directions.

My understanding from what you're saying is MX records = email (Zoho), A/CNAME = website (A Small Orange).

AKA I need to point the CName at ns1.aso.com or whatever it is, and the MX records at mx.zoho.com etc, and I should be able to get both up and running.

Is that right? I will definitely do some more research so I can properly get my head around it all, but it would be great to be pointed in the right direction.
Thanks - will do.
no you dont need to point any CNAMES to ns1.

-


**domain.com**

*A record* = 111.222.333.444

-


if you plan to use any subdomain like www. then point that to the same. So in that case:

**www.domain.com**

*A record* = 111.222.333.444

OR

*CNAME* = domain.com (which basically means its an alias of domain.com)

-

**domain.com**
MX Records = zoho IP

In case of multiple MX records, give them a weight of 1, 2, 3 etc.

Done.

All of the above should be done in GoDaddy.

Replace 111.222.333.444 with your site's IP address.
Your site's IP address can be found in the Account Information/Stats panel of cPanel, or you can contact Support to get help with finding that info. [\[Ref\]](https://kb.asmallorange.com/customer/portal/articles/1805059-point-your-domain-to-us)

Interesting, maybe work with javascript so you have to double click on the desktop icons to open them?
Everyone in this bathroom knows I'm fucking around on the internet.
I think that's going to be pretty hard to figure out without seeing your server side code. I did notice you have a lot of 404'd Javascript in your console, though.
Maybe your javascript handles part of this. But basically the `form` tag encloses only the left part of the form (name, phone, email). So the submit button and text are are not part of the form.

Also the form has no action attribute, so the browser would not even know where to send the data.

As said, javascript could handle this. But for pure HTML the form is not complete.
Inside http://heckslawncare.com/js/main.js - you have a `submit` event handler on the `#contactForm` element. The `submit` event is not being fired because your button is not inside the form.

Move your button (`<button id="form-submit" class="btn-outline" type="submit">Submit</button>`)  inside your form and it will work.
form-process.php

    <?php
    $name = $_POST["name"];
    $email = $_POST["email"];
    $tel = $_POST["tel"];
    $message = $_POST["message"];
     
    $EmailTo = "dchav90@gmail.com";
    $Subject = "New Message Received";
     
    // prepare email body text
    $Body .= "Name: ";
    $Body .= $name;
    $Body .= "\n";
     
    $Body .= "Email: ";
    $Body .= $email;
    $Body .= "\n";
    
    $Body .= "Telephone: ";
    $Body .= $tel;
    $Body .= "\n";
     
    $Body .= "Message: ";
    $Body .= $message;
    $Body .= "\n";
     
    // send email
    $success = mail($EmailTo, $Subject, $Body, "From:".$email);
     
    // redirect to success page
    if ($success){
       echo "success";
    }else{
        echo "invalid";
    }
     
    ?>    
main.js

    $("#contactForm").submit(function(event){
        // cancels the form submission
        event.preventDefault();
        submitForm();
    });
    
    function submitForm(){
        // Initiate Variables With Form Content
        var name = $("#name").val();
        var email = $("#email").val();
        var tel = $("#tel").val();
        var message = $("#message").val();
     
        $.ajax({
            type: "POST",
            url: "php/form-process.php",
            data: "name=" + name + "&email=" + email + "&tel=" + tel + "&message=" + message,
            success : function(text){
                if (text == "success"){
                    formSuccess();
                }
            }
        });
    }
    function formSuccess(){
        $( "#msgSubmit" ).removeClass( "hidden" );
    }
>I have the identical form on another site and it works. 

>$success = mail($EmailTo, $Subject, $Body, "From:".$email);

This could be the problem - the Send Mail crap isn't setup right on the server where it doesn't work.  This has been a constant pain in my ass problem for years.

It used to be *so easy* and then spammers ruined it and now you'll need to F with it to get the server to work the way you want.

you're javascript is fine. it's sends an http post to http://heckslawncare.com/php/form-process.php with the four form fields. your php returns an http 500 error, so it's something wrong on your php script.

is a mail server listening on that computer? try telnet port 25

Are you talking about the form at the very end of the page? **Convinced Yet** part? If so, it does work, just that the ajax response is an *Internal Server error*.
So namecheap helped me remedy the issue.

The issue with the 500 error was a problem in my file permissions. When I would ftp through filezilla, which is a problem with filezilla specifically, my folders would change from 0755 to 0654 (something or other). To fix this we made a cron job that would run a script to change these every 15 minutes. That fixed the 500 error but my form still didn't submit.

Ultimately it came down to the email address used in the form. Namecheap has internal validation that stops relaying (spam) such that only emails associated with the hosting account can be used in that form "emailTo".

Nevertheless, thanks for the help guys.
Still not working it seems. -_-
No validation at all? Enjoy your spam black listing!

[This article](http://www.thesitewizard.com/php/protect-script-from-email-injection.shtml) explains what I mean. 
well I did 
...
...telnet 104.219.248.89 25

telnet unrecognized. Does that mean 25 doesn't work or I'm doing something wrong?
While I have you, is there a better way to do this form submission thing?
My fix will submit your form (I tested it myself by dragging the button element inside the form using Chrome developer tools and can see you've edited your website live).

You have a problem with your PHP script most likely as when the POST request is made to `form-process.php`it returns a 500 Internal Server Error.
try to connect locally (via ssh) then telnet localhost 25 (in case your firewall is blocking remote connections)
can you turn on strict error checking and / or look at the server logs to see what the error is?
Digging further into that. Thanks for the help.
I added a php.ini file in folder php

        <?php
        
        error_reporting(E_ALL);
        
        ?>
If the server doesn't support svg for some reason:

    AddType image/svg+xml svg
    AddType image/svg+xml svgz

If it's PHP and I want clean URLS:

    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
    RewriteRule ^([^\.]+)$ $1.php [NC,L]

Redirects if you can't edit httpd.conf for some reason.

    Redirect 301 this/ that/

Thats legitimately incredible.
That's really cool. Not sure how close this would be to the Command and Conquer series, but I've been wanting someone to make a new version that is similar to how it worked in the 90s. I like how it's all in the browser. Really a fantastic concept.

Why not Homm3? :D
Does the 2 one have better features than the 3rd one? I know I prefer the 3 rather than the 6 but maybe it's just because of nostalgic reasons.
That's awesome! I had no idea that existed. 
Yeah maybe 3. But none after that. As far as I'm concerned Homm3 HAS NO SONS
IMO 2 and 3 are nearly identical in game play, though 3 has more units, races, maps, items, etc.
Thanks. Very helpful.
I use [gulp-connect](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-connect) with livereload enabled for most of my development.  [Brackets](http://brackets.io/) also has this feature built in.
Or just use a half-decent text editor which will do this for you. 

Typically faster than ctrl-r as it doesn't re-request resources. Makes for fat work when fiddling with CSS in particular. 
[deleted]
Sounds great. Can you introduce an editor like that please.
Agreed.
Pressing it once? No

Pressing it 148264 times over the course of a year? Yes.
Brackets does the auto refresh. It reloads the page though. Map a workspace in Chrome and you can edit and save in browser with instant update. 
You may want to consider looking into Gulp a little if you get some free time too. Browsersync is fantastic and it's editor-agnostic so it can be shared with a team that has different editors.

Things like Codekit will do this for you as well, but you cut out the linux/windows crowd by using them, and it doesn't watch all filetypes for a refresh (such as .twig files).
fantastic.
ver good point when you said it's important that we want team members with different browsers still be able to use this feature. 
I've been reading a great book over the last few weeks about game development in Javascript. If it's something you're interested in building games would showcase a lot of language features and force you into learning design patterns. Also, playing with HTML canvas is always fun!
A form, a database, a output page
Access to Real Estate Records API like MLS which they keep proprietary and barely ever allow new dev to hook into.
I can't put my idea out there but it won't be a "traditional " real estate website. My goal is to have my target "real estate agents" list directly from my site. I wouldn't need access to a MLS.
It would take a quality developer 1-6 weeks depending on ability/quality and project scope.
Your options are either to start learning web development from the beginning or start looking to hire a developer. This is probably a few thousand dollar project. Of course, because of your lack of details, it could be $500 or it could be $10,000.

Something like zillow though, requires many full time developers, so 100s of thousands.
Maybe you should try re-phrasing your question.
If you have `index.html` you can `vi index.html` in Terminal, and you'll be editing it with the vi editor. `:wq` will write and quit. Not sure exactly what your question is.
I think he means, trying to using hjkl to move the cursor around a normal shell, or `:wq` to close the terminal window. Which I do sometimes too.
So not only have they been DDoSed, they've been hacked _again_. No less than [5 hacks in 4 years](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10845278). (From the comments):

2. HTP hack, April 15, 2013 (CF exploit)

3. Second HTP hack April 16, 2013 (Another CF exploit)

4. MySQL server that allowed anonymous logins (?!?!) January 19, 2014

5. This hack

I have sympathy for them (albeit limited) for the DDoS but this is ridiculous. There's also [evidence](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10845985) that this particular breach has been around (and they've known about it) for _6 months_.
You can't actually reset your password now as their login site is getting DDoSed.

Fantastic.
Any idea why someone would be so intent on attacking them?
Is there any indication what the back-story is here?

From their status page:

>Effective immediately, Linode Manager passwords have been expired. You will be prompted to set a new password on your next login. We regret this inconvenience, however this is a necessary precaution. 

>A security investigation into the unauthorized login of three accounts has led us to the discovery of two Linode.com user credentials on an external machine. This implies user credentials could have been read from our database, either offline or on, at some point.

Unfortunately, I can't login to reset my password because their manager is under DDos attack now. 
If you have a quick read the database was compromised and 2fa was bypassed. Not much you can do to prevent a login directly to the hosts manager.
One reason to use git: branches. Say you want to test an idea with your html layout, style sheet, or play with some java script. Your site works fine now, and you don't want to break it if your idea doesn't work. 

Old way: make backups of the files before you edit them, make your changes and see if it works. If you don't like it, replace your files from backup. 

Git way: check out a new branch, name it something relevant like navbar-testing. Make your changes. If it works, merge back to master. If you don't like it delete the branch. No backups to maintain. 
Github is a tool, and like any other tool you as a developer have to decide if it's worth it to use. If you're merely playing around with an html and css file, and it's a really small project, then no it probably is not worth it to use version control.

But let's say you're working on a really large project, then consider Github as insurance for all your work, perhaps regardless if you're working solo, but infinitely more so if collaboratively.

The majority of companies out there use Github or some sort of version control, so yes it is a skill worth learning as well.
Some reasons why I find git useful, other than the usual version control:

* Commit messages. I can look back at the changes I made, and the reasons why they were made. Especially useful when it's been a while and I've forgotten why I took a particular approach.

* Replaces FTP. I find that cloning a repo on the server can be far easier than trying to upload everything via ftp.

* Offline storage. Instead of searching through my local file system for snippets of code, I can store them online, in a central location.

* Develop anywhere. Computer crashes? Left laptop at home and need to do some work? Borrow a computer, install git, clone repo and continue to work. Push changes back to repo, delete the work from the borrowed machine and pull back on to your own machine.

I find Git easier than FTP, to be honest. [Here's a nice little succinct article I wrote about Git](http://www.taniarascia.com/getting-started-with-git/) that might help you. I work on multiple computers, so Git is super helpful, and I like that there is a backup of all my files online, and that I can be sure all my files are the same across every device.

I use it for all my personal projects, many of which are simple HTML and CSS projects.
You're right. Don't worry about it for now. When the times comes to use it, you'll know.
Actually, if you are creating a small site, Github Pages is a solid way to learn Git.  Mostly you will just be doing commits and pulls.
You probably don't need it now, but if you start learning it now it will be much more familiar with you when you actually need it.
I store all my personal projects on Bitbucket, a Github alternative that offers free private repos. Git is absolutely worth learning, even for small things. Suppose you have an awesome new idea for your website but you also wanna keep a copy of its current state? No problem, create a branch. Remember that code snippet you deleted a month ago? You need to use it again. No problem, let's checkout an old commit. I can't explain how beneficial version control is and you won't really understand until you've worked on a large project with multiple developers. Having a good knowledge of it really will help though, I get coworkers asking me often how to do X or what X git command does. It's not as important as actually knowing how to code, but it's definitely worthwhile.
it can be overkill when starting out  but amongst other reasons:
 
 
if you ever find yourself copying the files your working on, writing some stuff, not liking it and pasting your backup back to undo changes you know its time for source control.
 

 
also its good if you want to review something you wrote but later removed.
One day you may want to work on a more complicated project, or with a team.  You'll need to use version control.  Or maybe you'll apply for a webdev job, and they'll ask "do you know git?", and if you can't confidently say "yes!", you'll have a (mild) mark against you, because it's one more thing you'll need to learn.

That being said, it's not that hard to learn, especially if you need it to be productive.  And it won't be particularly helpful now.  I'd ignore it for now, but keep in mind:  One day you'll be fiddling with this project or another one, and you'll say "wait, I'm doing this wrong", and you'll delete a bunch of code, and rewrite it, and then the next day or the next week you'll realize that was dumb and you'll wish you could undo that change.

With git, you can do that.  And that day you should go learn it so you don't have to suffer through the process a second time.  But until then, don't sweat it.
If you're just working on just a small personal project, you don't need to use GitHub.  As your skills and experience grow, you will encounter situations where you will need version control, but for now, you can keep it simple if you like.  

If you do want to learn GitHub, try using the GitHub desktop app, it's much easier to understand and use for beginners than the command line.
I feel your pain about using Git; we've all been there at some point.

What editor do you use? Most modern editors have a Git extension that will save you from having to use the command-line. No need to learn Git AND how to use the command-line at the same time.
In every one of those threads where beginners like me ask "what should I learn?", Github is always mentioned.

I thought I was dumb for not seeing its benefits for me.


Thanks for your time!

Heh. 
That's a useful article and it would've been even more useful if I would've found it a few days ago :D

I'll read through your other articles too. Thanks.

EDIT: Your blog is a gold mine.
Ok then, thanks!

I'll go learn Javascript or something :)
Well, I tried doing just that.

I'm using Sublime Text 2.
I was hoping some people would catch that.
:) Thank you! I try. The issue is getting it out there, because I know how many people can benefit from it (like me, several days before writing each article, haha).
You might have already set this up, but this looks like a nice tutorial:

No, I don't. That looks nice.
No problem. If you have any questions, hit me up with a PM.
Plenty of terrible hosts run those features on Wordpress installations, so it's not a blanket statement.

Now, if you're asking because a developer has told you that you need to move off a cPanel environment and you are second guessing it.. listen to your developer.
Pretty much every host and their dog includes at least one MySQL database with most plans these days. If you're using shared hosting then your site is likely going to be slow regardless of what you do, but simple sites often run fine on any old toaster, assuming they're well-written. 

If you're doing things yourself, you could pick up a cheap VPS or a droplet, or Heroku setup... There's a lot of options. Either way, your database shouldn't slow things down too much unless you've got some poorly-written code, or a database with millions of tables or rows.
No I'm doing it myself but I'm rather inexperienced. Like right now I just use Wamp and the PhPMyAdmin thing that it comes with. All of my code (PHP) works fine and the database interacts with the site properly. However, I have no idea what I would be doing when it comes to real databases or how to connect a website to them or what hosting features I am looking for.
ok thanks
My current task is a Drupal template. Grrr!
I make WordPress templates from scratch, so no plugins, just a lot of creating custom post types in functions.php and so on. First I design the site in HTML and CSS, then I splice it up into a WordPress theme and go from there. This way, clients can update, and I still do everything in code.
You realize WordPress themes are made with code that you can hook into an awesome backend that has thousands of hours of development put into it? 

I think you would be pleasantly surprised at how powerful it can be to build a theme on your own and instantly have a user friendly, familiar CMS and blog system built in, and I get the feeling your frustration comes from downloading or buying a theme that a customer likes and customizing it for them. 

Try creating a theme from scratch and I think you'll find it's pretty easy and much more fun than customizing someone else's work. 
Is it fairly easy turning a site made from HTML/CSS and Bootstrap into a WordPress theme? 
[Here's an article on how to do exactly that](http://www.taniarascia.com/developing-a-wordpress-theme-from-scratch/).

In short, I do it all the time and I think it's easy.
Ahhh perfect thanks :)
I'm not bored. Get out of your comfort zone and find something that excites you.
You're bored because you're doing the same thing day in day out. The industry is moving forward without you.

Take a look at Elixir or Ruby or Python. Those languages don't have brackets if you're so hung up on looking at languages with C inspired syntax.
A bit sad to see that nobody's mentioning that you could contribute to open-source projects.

Pick whichever you like and feel like you have what it takes to contribute to and simply start picking off issues and implementing features accepted. This is a lot of fun and it's often greatly appreciated.
Yep, after 15+ years professionally I'm tired of it to. It pays well, it's easy, I feel like I'm pretty decent at it, but it's no longer exciting to me. This was through both full time jobs and full time freelancing. It feels very different to me where everything feels like a rewrite, rehash, reimplementation of what's been done before. I don't look forward to learning new frameworks, tools, systems, etc. The web isn't as "new" as it used to be and much of the challenging work that was fun has been solved.

I recently took on a different line of work doing 3D development for less money which is what I was always really passionate about when I was younger but never had a good opportunity (read: paid/professional) to really go after it since the web exploded. Now that I'm back into it, I really love the work and I'm spending a lot of time working with next gen tech and motion capture (myo, leap motion, oculus rift, xsens, RealSense, etc). The next generation of VR/AR is on the cutting edge and there is a lot of untapped potential so it feels like how the web felt a long time ago (kind of that return to the wild west the web used to be). Try breaking out and doing something different that is NOT web related even if you take a pay cut. If you have savings/ability to maybe quit your job/work for a while and take a break or pursue a different path (not programming related).

The other option is maybe do a startup that isn't focused on the tech but rather the problem/business. You likely have a lot of useful skills that you could leverage to build something and then run a company you are passionate about.
I feel the same, but there's also lots of exciting stuff going on...learn a new language or something! However, I do get discouraged sometimes because I feel like I'm not good enough to contribute something of value because all the low hanging fruit has been picked 
Go read a book.
Then you can create something great, to better humanity, with your expertise. You are now at your full potential. Use it.
Look into AI. 
At work.. *maybe* but that depends on the sprint. Usually I'm having a decent time. I also like to do stuff at home though.

To compound on but also contradict what others have said, I say you build something but really **own** it. It doesn't have to be the greatest thing since Google or Facebook, but the fact that it's yours will make it exciting. For [example](http://qz.com/476914/i-built-a-twitter-bot-that-entered-and-won-1000-online-contests-for-me/). Or another [one](https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-skills-kit).

Try this out and report back to me.
I've been experiencing a similar dilemma. I've been in web dev for over 4 years and even though my current role has allowed me to work on a variety of applications, they are all fundamentally similar. 
I would love to learn about things like Angular, React, Laravel, and so on, but what for? Why should I care if, at the end of the day, I'm just making yet another CRUD app? 

Like others here have suggested, I decided it's time to start thinking outside the box. 

Being a long-time gamer, the idea of making a game has always interested me but I haven't been sure how to start. Today, there is a plethora of game development tools that use web languages. Two popular ones are Phaser and PlayCanvas. Both are very powerful and have strong communities behind them.

Developing for games doesn't have to mean "making a game" either. Maybe it would be interesting to create an app for a game? Games like Guild Wars 2 provide an API that the community can use to create apps that use the game's data. Want to know where to find the gear you want and how to get there? You can make that app.

Gaming aside, the graphical capabilities of the web continue to intrigue me. WebGL is continually gaining momentum and is making me wish I had taken a college course in computer graphics. Libraries like three.js and BabylonJS are showing how it is changing the face of the web.

Web technologies are being integrated many different types of applications too. GitHub created the open source Atom editor which you can hack with HTML and JS. You can buy an Arduino and program it with JS to control a robot. 

My point is to figure out what interests you and use your skills to explore those interests. 
I've been programming since grade school, and professionally for the last 8 or so years.

My current job is great - the projects are interesting, the people are fun to hang with. I work with some of the smartest people I know. I get a nice mix of client projects, internal projects, and research & development time.

I get to learn new technologies, build cool stuff, travel to conferences, speak at conferences - been to Vegas, Boston,  California for work. 

A good environment and company can account for a lot. I was tired of my old job, burning out on software development, tired of feeling like I was being grinded to the bone every day. My new job has sparked an excitement for programming that I had thought I had lost.


Yeah this is great advice! I definitely feel the same doing  web design/dev  for such a long time. Like you, I'm getting into 3D design and am very curious about doing stuff in Unity (game dev but still someone new); I also got to play with Leap Motion at a conference I attended as well. It's very refreshing and exciting seeing what direction VR is going. I've attended a few meet ups where people were showing off their works and they were pretty awesome and some downright silly.

OP -- have you tried looking into hardware like Arduino, Raspberry Pi, Beaglebone, or things of that nature? Maybe try doing something more physical and tangible. 

Or how about instead of coding another app or website you make something "artistic" like using something like Open Frameworks, webGL, or Processing? There's ton of examples out there to see and a good one I like is Memo Atkin's (www.memo.tv) works.

I know when I played around with these that I started to get excited about development again.
But that's my point....learn a new language to do what? Build another angry birds? Build another Facebook, or Twitter? *meh*
I've thought about it...actually more than reading a book, but I think part of my problem is I'm just surrounded by technology all the time I'm drowning in it.
I kinda am...

Edit: I think it's being done wrong anyways.
Not to be an asshole, but this is exactly what the world doesn't need.
Well why not try something new that isn't programming related? There's more to this world than code.
Learn management
I found learning a new language (Elm) exposed me to a bunch of new concepts that I never would have seen if I stuck to JS... It got me excited about webdev again and curious.     
  
  
There's more to learning a language than learning to do the same thing with different syntax :) Choices the language make can open your eyes to new awesome shit or fun tools you can contribute to! 
Dunno m8, building another Facebook is probably hard. I hear Mr. Zuckerberg has quite a few engineers.
Can't you just build a better alternative to LinkedIn. That concept is awesome but it's really badly done. Or a good scrum tool since there doesn't exists a really good one neither. No I disagree with you, there are a lot of challenges still out there. Waiting to be solved! 
Aha! There you are then.
Then pick up the torch and do it right! :-D
dont be rude. hes offering a suggestion. hes not the one who is bored and complaining to reddit about his job.
Not that hard. A database and some simple PHP would get the posting/timeline bits done. Just do the message system and some final touches and voila, Facebook 2.0.
These are ideas I've thought of...
Especially LinkedIN, that's an abomination. 
and this particular suggestion would only create even *more* people doing that.
So... What is holding you back? 
the framework doesn't need to be a success or used by anyone. it can be a great learning experience and you can learn why other frameworks do what they do, the trade offs they make and why
Looks OK to me. What browser, what viewport width, and where exactly on the page is it doing this? 
If you bought it they most likely offer support to help you set it up.

Do you have a link to your implementation that doesn't work? (The theme page itself seems to work fine.)
All of them :( Viewport I believe is 375px when it breaks.

This is what page insight tells me at least:

>The page content is 406 CSS pixels wide, but the viewport is only 375 CSS pixels wide. The following elements fall outside the viewport:
The element <img src="img/screen2.png" class="fotorama__img"> falls outside the viewport.

It looks like this: [Link](http://i.imgur.com/ehudbuU.png)

If you shrink the browser to the smallest size, it should do it for you as well.

It does this on my iPhone 4 in Chrome and Safari, as well as my friends smaller Android device.
The guy said it's broken and he should have an update for it mid January. But the theme is 2 years old, I don't see how he couldn't have fixed it by then?

And I think you'll find the theme itself is broken once you scale it down to mobile size as /u/mr_bacon_pants found as well.

It doesn't work on my iPhone or my friends smaller android device either. The image pops out on mine and my friends looks similar to [this](http://i.imgur.com/Gb6gnaJ.png) 

Ah I see, yeah it looks like crap on mobile. The images stay in the slider for me, but [this happens](http://i.imgur.com/Gb6gnaJ.png). Have you tried to contact the developer?
I actually get mixed results. Sometimes it's broken, like when I tried to open it inside the RSS reader, but it seems to work *mostly* fine in my Chrome (47.0.2526.106, OSX El Capitan). 

The bug I get instead is that the [inner content of the phone gets pushed to the side](http://imgur.com/38ZEjzE
) but the slideshow itself is intact.

But I do also get the bug you show in your screenshot but only from inside the RSS reader, (Vienna), and I don't know what web engine it uses.

Haven't had a chance to look on a real phone though. But I agree that it seems broken. 
It sucks right? lol :(

I did contact him. He said he would have an update for it mid January. The theme is like 2 Years old though, so not very confident it's going to work by then. Plus I was hoping to launch this week.

Just sucks. It was only $14 bucks, but when you spend $14 bucks for one thing, and it doesn't even work? It's shitty.
Yep, that's the issue! 

I can't seem to find a fix for it. I keep trying to adjust to size properties of the images/iPhone itself but to no avail.

Very frustrating.
It makes sense in that websites will probably work better in the short term, though I'd rather web devs make an effort to remove old prefixes.  This seems messier.  But we all know how unlikely that is to happen.

I also find it strange that they're doing so now.  It seemed vendors were finally moving away from prefixes.  Google never implemented a new one for Blink, for instance.

Moz first talked about this [years ago](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2012Feb/0313.html), but it seemed they lost interest.  I wonder what changed.

Ultimately though, it's not the end of the world.  Prefixes were already messy to begin with, so it's not like they're sullying something perfect.  Maybe we'll reach a point where we can finally drop some backwards compatibility to clean things up (especially user agents).
Is that fox taking a dump ? 
So WebKit really is the new IE.

I think perhaps the standards committee is moving too slowly. Yes, by delaying the standards making, with more real world experiments to tell which way is the right way, you will have a better standard. But because developers so demand the new features right now, the non-standard effectively becomes a standard.
The responses I'm seeing here are absolutely ludicrous. Everyone on this sub should already know that there's nothing at all wrong with browsers introducing new CSS features using a prefix. It's a very simple and effective solution to avoid future incompatibilities while also preventing them from stepping on each other's toes. Placing the blame on Webkit because there are too many web developers who neglected to properly code for multiple browsers is completely absurd.
The comments on there are not what I expected. I like webkit.

Oh boy, User Agent confusion all over again
#NOooo....!
Mozilla has been disappointing me a lot lately. First they integrated "Hello", then [ads based on your browsing history](https://blog.mozilla.org/advancingcontent/2015/09/10/first-wave-suggested-tiles-partners-live/), then made a deal with Pocket, and now [removed the ads](https://blog.mozilla.org/advancingcontent/2015/12/04/advancing-content/) so they can "reimagine content experiences and content discovery in our products."  
  
Your company makes a fucking browser. The more "discovery" (read: paid partnerships) you integrate into your products the closer you are to your inevitable doom.  
  
I was a longtime Mozilla supporter. I watched the documentaries, drank the cool-aid, bought the Firefox Wired mag with Goodger on the cover, bought a fucking newspaper just to get my copy of a community purchased ad. But they have drifted so incredibly far from what made them great in the first place that it's hard to stay loyal or defend them any longer.  
  
It used to be that if you were feeling fed-up with your browser you could switch to Opera and wait for improvements in the other options. But even Opera's gone now (in my mind at least).  
  
I feel like we learned absolutely nothing from the browser wars in the 90's and early 2000's. History is repeating itself here.
Great, more abdication and weakness strategy from Mozilla.
Better question, will every browser ever agree on what happens when you mix 'overflow: scroll' and 'padding-bottom'?

It's CSS 2, but webkit and moz/ie behave differently.

https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=748518
> I'd rather web devs make an effort to remove old prefixes.

Good fucking luck. There are a billion websites out there run by people/companies that do not care to pay some developer for their time to fix their broken site.
There's an incongruity in output between Firefox for iOS (which uses the system's webkit engine) and Firefox for Android which uses Gecko, meaning two friends sitting side by side from one another both using "Firefox" could potentially have radically different experiences. That's probably helped contribute to the decision. Plus if there are a ton of mobile sites that don't have -moz- prefixes, then you really weren't getting much out of using Firefox for Android than using Chrome.

IMHO, Firefox on Android should really clean up its default input styling more than anything else. It always wrecks the designs of the sites that I use, and forces me to have to remove background images on inputs that otherwise don't exist on every other browser.
This should be the top comment.
No, WebKit **ALSO** supports the standard tags.  WekKit prefixed these tags because they didn't exist in the spec at the time they were introduced (WebKit was ahead of the game).  That's what browsers are supposed to do (in the event the standard change names, or features).  When the CSS standard gained support, WebKit supported both the "new" and prefixed tags. 

This is strictly targeted to developers who did t go back and update their code once the tags were standardized. 
Given the amount of websites "optimized for chrome" these days, yes it is. 
Freaking FF, first with their FirefoxOS fantasies, and now this!

What happened?
> webkit monoculture

Only Safari uses WebKit. Chrome and Opera use Blink.

Just take a look at how much WebKit and Blink diverged in the first year:

http://browserg.nom.es/

Now add 150% more of that and you'll arrive at the present day.

> independent standards

Mh? Ever looked at the author list of some spec? The browser vendors are always involved.
That might have been the case, but I don't think this holds true any more., what with standards not all having to be published at the same time, but features coming out when they are done. Combined with browsers no longer using vendor prefixes but just hiding them behind a flag (since the next release is only six weeks away), this should no longer be necessary in the future.
I think the issue is that webkit doesn't 100% comply with WC3 standards while Mozilla does. They're ('zilla) now implementing the same non-standard support that webkit has had for compatability.
WebKit is fine (Google forked it instead of starting from scratch).  
   
Many of these comments are misinformed, and think this is something WebKit is doing differently.   Or somehow "non-standard".  It really couldn't be further from the truth. 
Nothing is free
They have spent the better part of a decade fighting against this, and trying to get lazy web devs to fix their crap. It hasn't worked. All that's left is to try to turn these non-standards into standards (like HTML's quirks mode), so that non-WebKit browsers don't have a competitive disadvantage.
This behavior doesn't appear to be covered by spec.  If it matters to you, use a workaround.  I'd suggest an inner element to apply padding.
>time to fix their ~~broken~~ non-compliant site.

FTFY

It's one thing to ignore something that's broken, but when it's working by using "hacky" code, it'll never get worked on. 
> fix their broken site

It's not even broken, really. So long as it looks like it's working, there is absolutely no incentive for a company to pay expensive web developers to come in and "fix" something that already works and offers no tangible benefit to the company's bottom line.


Now it is
Might not be as buggy, but once other browsers start following the leader here, it will still be affecting the development of future standards. Rather than having any really testing and development, it is likely many of the standards will be based on how WebKit decided to do it.
They should deprecate them and then drop them!
Since Chrome uses Blink, not WebKit, I can't tell whether or not this is snark.
No, the problem is that there are many people who didn't use vendor prefixes correctly. You're supposed to include the other versions and the unprefixed version as well. People who're using some preprocessor usually do that. People who write it manually often only used the "-webkit-" version.
Rules can be bent.
Google was using Webkit for years before they forked it.
Except the entire codebase of FOSS projects. Like Firefox.
This is a long running symptom, not the disease.  The same crap has been happening since the 90s, going at least as far back as `div` and `layer`.  That's right kids, there used to be two proposed semantically null block level elements that leaked into production.

CSS vendor prefixes were supposed to fix that kind of stuff, not create a new round of it.

Developers (read: designers) will pounce on anything new and cool regardless of the long term consequences.  There are no mechanisms in place to keep experimental or not-yet-standardized code out of production sites.  They're also selectively lazy.

The primary disease is the W3C, and every browser vendor is a secondary infection.  The W3C is a pathetically weak standards organization that is incapable of enforcing any of their "recommendations" (itself a weak term) and has very little forethought as it rushes into the future.  The browser vendors enable this by catering to not just non-standard code, but invalid code.  Blame and expectations are misplaced all the time.

And the HTML5 authors did everything they could to allow developers to be lazier.  At least the W3C put a stop to the "living standard" nonsense.  We've never been able to hit fixed targets as well as we should, and they wanted us to shoot at a perpetually moving target.

Don't call a browser broken because it doesn't support another browser's custom shit.  That's like saying your gas-powered car is broken because it won't run on diesel.

Blame the devs that stray beyond the standards.  Start putting visual clues in the browser to indicate when anything is invalid and clearly explain that the site is broken, not the browser.  We need to start shaming the sites that keep adding to this problem.
> it is likely many of the standards will be based on how WebKit decided to do it.   
   
I'm guessing you weren't around in the beginning of web dev, but this is exactly how the web is supposed to (and has always) evolved.  One vendor pushes a feature, everyone else implements their way of doing it, and finally a standard is made to get everyone on the same page.
Mozilla is doing this to help developers, not to help WebKit.  Dropping the prefixes doesn't do anything constructive at this time.  Unless the vendor prefixes are really, really, REALLY wrong -- all it takes is a line or two of code to support webkit-FEATURE vs. mozkit-FEATURE vs. FEATURE.
That isn't a very good solution, since it would also break sites that that properly implemented the feature prior to standardization by using each of the prefixes. That's doing more harm than good.
Blink is a fork of WebKit.
>Chrome uses <Blink>

Momentary panicked flashback there.
[deleted]
This is a dumb question but why would you want to include the vender prefixes if the unprefixed works? Backwards compatibility?


Indeed, but browsers should also be consistent.
[deleted]
>Developers (read: designers) will pounce on anything new and cool regardless of the long term consequences.
>The primary disease is the W3C

This is shifting the blame. The W3C is a symptom, not the disease.

The real problem is that a confluence of events caused the "prefixes" idea to be rendered meaningless, before it was even properly tested to see if it would solve any real problems.

Apple abused the feature to flood the market with a ton of non-standard features for the iPhone and practically encouraged adoption before they even could be standardized, thus rendering the feature pointless. The iPhone was a hit, and devs who didn't care about standards farted out a lot of stuff that looked good on Mobile Safari, without caring about the longer-term consequences (and STILL don't want to fix it, if indeed they've even allowed to try).

>Don't call a browser broken because it doesn't support another browser's custom shit.

I'm not. People who don't care about these things do.

>We need to start shaming the sites that keep adding to this problem.

Who's "we"? Lots of us have been working towards it, including Mozilla. See [webcompat](https://webcompat.com/) for instance. It's not working terribly well.

>Start putting visual clues in the browser to indicate when anything is invalid

Mozilla actually was doing this (they had it half-implemented), but the Edge developers decided to just implement the Webkit prefixes, whereupon Mozilla realized it was futile to be idealistic about this anymore.

Now they might as well standardize these non-standard features, so Edge and Webkit and Firefox can support them in basically the same way, rather than the horrible mess we have.
And it's a process that has worked especially well in CSS (compared to HTML or JS) as a direct result of vendor prefixes.
I was refferring to Webkit dropping the deprecated extensions.
I was refferring to Webkit dropping the deprecated extensions.
I don't see any issue with browsers being required to sunset support of their specific tags once it is standardized. Give them 12 or 18 months.  That should be well within the release cycle of any site that is reasonably maintained.
iOS is a fork of OSX (Darwin), that doesn't make them the same.
Don't worry, we have css animations for that now! Let's take <blink> into the new millenium!
Compare Chrome and Safari over at HTML5test and caniuse. They drifted apart during the last 2.5 years. There are hundreds of commits each month. Safari requires way more prefixes.
Many people, like the second-level comment that this discussion is based on, don't even know that Chrome is no longer using WebKit.

EDIT: If you've ever looked at the source, you'll see that there are tons of changes. And if you ever look at the issue trackers, you'll see that there are a ton of discrepancies between the two at this point.
Because not all browsers support the unprefixed version yet. You always have to check which prefixes you still need.

For example, if you want to use Element.matches in IE9 to Edge 13, you still have to provide an msMatchesSelector fallback.

But if you want to use requestAnimationFrame, you won't need a single prefixed version anymore. They are all obsolete. However, if you still care for IE9, you'll need a polyfill. An "ms" prefixed version of this never existed. So, including that prefix never did anything.
Yes, exactly that.
My websites must work with all browsers. I welcome webkit to ff.
The point is that they were a non-profit with clearly defined goals that had nothing to do with increasing revenue. But due to scope creep they now need hundreds of millions of dollars a year.
Yes, they probably should. But it's really difficult to do for backward compatibility reasons - they'd break a large chunk of the "mobile" web.
Yes, I understood that. It would break sites, including some that work in other browsers.
â€¦in order to solve an issue with sites that *aren't* properly maintained?

Also, required by *who*?
If it was that simple, Webkit and Blink would have removed the pre-standard versions long ago. That's the inherent problem with the prefix method, and why it was sadly a failure: you can't trust web developers to only use them as pre-production features meant for testing; they will just use whatever they can, standard or not.
Blink is _a lot_ closer to WebKit than iOS is to OS X, at the very least in terms of how it looks to developer, probably also in terms of amount of code shared. Blink even uses the -webkit- prefix.
<marquee><blink>Bow to your sensei!</blink></marquee>
If all browsers were consistent you'd know that if it worked in one browser it'd work in all browsers.  I think this is the point of Nimoi's argument.
Show deprecated warnings for an year then drop them.
Also to tack onto this end-users see a broken browser, not an unmaintained website.
They aren't only intended for testing.
I rest here.
We're talking about sites that *aren't* being properly maintained.
I dunno. I think when most people come across a janky website, they don't try to reopen it in another browser. They just leave.
That's essentially what they were supposed to be, but apparently everyone missed the memo and they became an excuse to ship non-standard features in a browser, while claiming you were still following standards.
Good point!
The belief that implementations are built after standardization is a common fallacy. It's always been the other way around. Browsers have always added features, which are then implemented as standards. The CSS prefixing is intended to be a way to make it possible for web developers to use these new features without having to resort to ugly hacks like browser sniffing.

The issue isn't that prefixed CSS properties are being used outside testing, the issue is that they're being used without following the most basic set of practices (like testing in multiple browsers).
>The belief that implementations are built after standardization is a common fallacy.

It's also not what I said.

>The issue isn't that prefixed CSS properties are being used outside testing

Yes, it is. It was meant as a means for people to test a potential feature before it was standardized (ie, to help develop the standard version). Users abused it as a means to access cool new non-standard features for production sites. This is why we have production sites lingering out there which should work everywhere now, but don't, and which no one wants to fix. Which is the problem we're discussing. It's also why browser vendors have (pretty much) switched over to hiding these pre-release features behind flags, rather than activating them by default.
You'll need to go a little more advanced than just a basic html page. Client-side code (i.e. JavaScript) can't read the filesystem, so you'd need some sort of server running on your computer (IIS, Apache, etc.). How exactly to go about this then would vary depending on the backend you went with.

Are you wanting to do this as something to actually learn or more just to have this ability? If it's the latter, why not check out something like Plex?
Try dragging the .avi file into your browser.  The address bar will show a url to the file (you might get a browser warning when doing this, not sure). In any case the url will look something like file://... And you can use this in an a tag wrapped around a .jpg of your movie poster.
I guess what I want is a complete layout of my movies to the point where I click on the image of the movid and it plays it through my VLC media player

So a list of movie posters that play just by clicking said poster is what I want to make and thought it might be possible through doing code but, if I can just have something do it for me then that'd be even better lol
Python? Wordpress? Drupal? Angular? Now that's some serious new trends for 2016!
Do you have a portfolio? Github? Any projects online?  If not, get all 3 and start contacting web agencies in your area asking for a junior position.  A junior position is a 'still-learning' job.
I can hire you.  I require 2 years experience with php, python, java, sql, jquery, node, and I need someone who is really good at pleasing my wife, because apparently I can't.
Some bad responses here.  

First, if your existing work is a bunch of crap then dont put it into a portfolio - the only thing worse than no portfolio is a bad portfolio full of crap.  This will guarantee you not getting a job.  

Second, you dont need a degree and you dont need to be the expert you think you do. You also dont need all the frameworks and tools out there (you learn them gradually as you accumulate experience over time). 

As a junior programmer you need enthusiasm, work ethic, humbleness (a small ego), willingness to learn etc. You also need to know the basics of HTML, CSS and Javascript and some jQuery (not in depth, but enough to say recreate the web page you are looking at right now). If you dont have these basic skills yet get onto tutorial sites (codetuts, w3schools, codecademy, youtube) and start following the tutorials.  

You can advertise on Craigslist that you are looking for a Junior web developer position. Look for $12-$15 per hour which is the going rate to train someone with basic skills. After 18 months expect your salary to go up significantly.  

So steps:  

1. Learn basic html, css, javascript, jquery using tutorial sites  
2. Advertise on Craigslist as a Junior Developer wanting work for $12 per hour - put in the ad that you are enthusiastic, keen to learn etc.  Also apply to any junior developer positions you see regardless of the skills required also saying you are enthusiastic, a quick learner etc.  
3. Go thru the subreddits like /r/learnprogramming and look for someone who might mentor you a little bit, or peers at the same level you are and message them to try to get a support group together for your learning. If you have 3 or 4 people at the same level learning together with one mentor, you will get better very quickly.  

I cannot emphasize enough for you to ignore all those fluffy skills out there right now like Angular, React, Gulp, Grunt, Node, Bower, Bootstrap, etc. Learn the basics first, then slowly read about various libraries and frameworks as you go. If you try to learn too much too quickly you will give up and be very frustrated. 
Soooo many... When I was just starting out I'd look for any random gig on craigslist that I thought I could do. The pay isn't great, usually the work is pretty dumb, and it's almost always independent contractor stuff, but it'll get you experience and some $$$
Having a degree maybe matters to some hiring managers, but what matters most to everyone is knowledge and confidence. You can wow the pants off of anybody having an API memorized, but that only gets you through the interview. Being able to think on your feet, understand troubleshooting, and being confident even if you think you're wrong can carry you far into your career. 

That is not to say you should be pig-headed about your decisions. It, imo, is worse to be stubborn than timid. But instead you should listen and consider other's opinions when making decisions. Acknowledging when you're uncertain shows humility, not weakness. For example, if you're asked a tough question that you have no clue how to answer, say you don't know, and then write it down so you can look it up later. That shows initiative and a willingness to learn. Jobs love initiative and a willingness to learn. 

Code. Write lots of meaningful code, and publish it. What is meaningful? That is subjective, but there are a lot of common points to work on:

* consistency: pick a coding style and stick with it. Nobody likes reading the digital equivalent of chicken scratch
* standards: coding style aside, learn the [FIG standards](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/)
* understand what [SOLID](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_\(object-oriented_design\)) and [DRY](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) are, and how they are used in programming
* pick and learn a [framework](https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=data-r11&hw=peak&test=fortune&l=sg); if unsure, look at what job postings are asking for in your area 

Take all of the above and create a meaningful long-term project to apply it to and work on it constantly. It is useful to you so you can try new things and learn, and it shows employers your commitment and desire to the job. 

Lastly, take all advice with a rain of salt. What works for me may not work for you. But if you listen and think on your feet, I'm sure you can find something useful in the above and make it your own. 

PHP is great because it has a low barrier to entry. But that is also one of its Achille's Heels. If you take the time to learn theories and fundamentals, you will put yourself ahead of the pack by many orders of magnitude. The best of luck to you, and never be afraid to ask silly questions. 
Companies and the industry as a whole are still too immature to discern good from mediocre in a job interview.   So,  no,  the salary range is mostly the same for very good versus mediocre. 
I was hired at a small agency four years ago, at age 19, with virtually no experience aside from the outdated web design courses I had taken in high school. I didn't have a portfolio, Github (I couldn't have even told you what Github was at that point), or really any discernible skills at all. I was hired as a junior for $12/hr. I found the job listing on Craigslist.

I spent four years at the company and just recently left. I spent a long time feeling the way you did though. I'd feel guilty because most things would take me way longer than they would a more seasoned developer. But it's what got me into the field and now I'm making my first attempt at freelancing.

My only warning would be this: try to determine whether your senior developer is a good mentor. Mine wasn't and I think it set me back quite a bit.

Admittedly, I think I kind of lucked into my job, but you never know what could happen, especially since you actually have some experience. I definitely think Craigslist is a good place to start.
Freelance sites are your best bet to be honest.

Upwork and Freelancer are two of the biggest and you will find jobs if you're willing to bid low enough. The problem with freelance work is that it is not constant and therefore, a stable wage is not guaranteed.

A lot of design/web studio development shops that operate on the principle of churning out client work at a fast pace generally will hire inexperienced developers, because they're not offering competitive pay for the advertised role. Just be prepared to wear more hats than any other job.

Also, no degree is not a setback. I have no degree and I am currently leading a front end development team. I earn a decent salary as well and I am completely self-taught. I have interviewed candidates with degrees who could not even answer basic simple questions when asked and were not hired.
My first thought was a freelance site like Upwork or Elance. Other than that, probably Craigslist, it's usually bottom-priority for finding developer jobs.
Whats your skillset
I have the same problem, with the added bonus that I'm committed to my job for at least three more years. I'm loving React, Node, and GoLang, but no jobs with those exist as a part-time off-hours job. 
Anyone who wants either a WordPress content manager, or someone to do HTML emails. 
>If there are entry level jobs for 40,000...are there any like, still-learning jobs for minimum wage? Or even volunteer jobs that don't expect me to have three years experience? Am I looking in the wrong places?

Yeah, tons and tons (but I guess it depends on where you live.)

Seriously, figure out what you want to work on - front end?  Back end?  What language/frameworks?

Then put together a resume, a portfolio of some work and contact some headhunters.  

And...  OH look!  

https://i.imgur.com/ohul12C.jpg
Internship positions ... Or somewhere like an ecommerce site where you are one of a half dozen doing small tedious tasks. 

Also just go look for SEO work, requires just enough skill to use a CMS correctly. 
So, what exactly do people mean when they talk about a portfolio? I have a really strange range of projects. I've made [a goofy TF2 minigame](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/7196819/TF2%20game/index.html). I've made bootstrap-template [business websites](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/7196819/Metal%20detecting%20website%20and%20game/METAL%20DETECTING%20WEBSITE/index.html) (with more goofy minigames) to [gag websites](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/7196819/RUSSELL_WEBSITE/index.html) to totally non-commissioned [website designs](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/7196819/POP_Website/index.html) to, like, one actual commissioned [single-page site](http://www.crec.org/readeveryday/). Since I just tried to make something a little different for practice each time. Can I just...mention all of them? Or is it too all-over-the-place. It seems weird to show off both from-scratch websites and then bootstrap reskins and then a slow-running fps in the same sitting.
Now that's what I call entry-level.
Broo I got 3 years experience pleasing your wife... Hire me as a senior dev?
Agree with this. For example, don't look at CSS preprocessors until you feel very comfortable with CSS. I'd argue the same about jQuery/other helper libraries and JavaScript, as well as tooling.

Though to be fair I did learn jQuery before I *learned* JavaScript - wouldn't recommend that!
> First, if your existing work is a bunch of crap then dont put it into a portfolio

So this is where I'm a bit unsure; I'm having trouble trouble figuring out what exactly would count as crap.

The best thing I think I've made so far is this [silly TF2 minigame](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/7196819/TF2%20game/index.html). 

It's uses, I dunno, the basics like OOP and it has some clever coding in it, like the pythagorean theorem for random bullet spread, but also: I don't really know good practices so for all I know it's gibberish that just happens to work. Also I really don't know optimization so it runs poorly and you have to zoom out on most monitors. Would something like that still be something I could show off? Or is a laggy game clearly written by an amateur gonna just highlight that I'm making it up.
Yup, this is the way to go. I'm employed full time but it's been getting old working on the one internal site I've been developing at my day job for ...a year and a half now. I've got one site (that I'm procrastinating on Reddit for/)working on right now, one I'm gonna start once I get the former's framework configured and layout completed, and another I need to call the guy about to let him know I'm ready to start. These are all old clients, though. I don't need to search Craigslist much these days, but...eh, I'll take a look... Problem with Craigslist is these days I've got enough clout to not try to low-bid every job, so I'm not gonna develop someone's site for $300 and let them make change requests for 2 months and pay me a month late.
Thanks for this comment. I think this is what I needed.
Pro tip: Always get a new job every two years.  
I'll second this. You learn how to estimate your time, interact with clients, and navigate different setups. Starting off you won't make a ton, but you will really learn to think on your feet.
They mean have your projects on Github ;).

If you don't know what Git is, learn it as it's important for web development (or at least the concepts of version control are, and Git is widely used).

Go create a Github account and push all of your code there, and then link it in your resume.  If you don't know how to do any of that, google it and make sure you show people the actual code you used to make those projects.

Code speaks louder than buzzwords :)  (Well to the developers at least, you need buzzwords if you wanna pass the recruitment filters if you're using recruiters)

Also, I don't have a CS degree and am working at a phenomenal place for great pay and great work life balance.  (Albeit I AM in a big metro area: Boston)  CS Degree doesn't matter, what you need is a great portfolio of things you've learned and built to show your skill, and your ability to learn on your own.
What I meant by a portfolio is a personal website listing your projects with some info about them basically.  I would say you should cut it down to your best work.  Avoid the bootstrap reskins and focus on the custom stuff.  I personally had 3 items on mine when I got my first job.

Keep making projects, maybe do some more javascript focused stuff, make a portfolio, and you should be able get a job easily.

Oh and learn and use git too.
This is definitely enough to get an entry level position. You at least have a good concept of spacing and typography, and your average client doesn't know or care if it was made with Bootstrap. Just keep learning and applying.
Sounds like pen testing
I hate to say it, but yes this is crap (from the perspective of an employer).  

Create a couple of simple web sites, create a form with some back-end functionality, create a little front end to reddit RSS feeds, create a SB with some data and some charts that run off that data. Make sure your code is accessible and well documented and structured.   

seriously I am glad I'm not the only one considering taking shitty questionable work just because I get super bored focusing so hard on the same site(s) at my fulltime.
This. These are where the real pay rises are most of the time.
Yeah, after maintaining my 500k line codebase at work all day it's nice to do a new design and throw together a site with like, 2k lines, for someone. ...still procrastinating on it right now though...
Agreed, after 2 years my last job wasn't offering me a pay raise. Other companies were offering me 5 figure raises. Easy choice.
Your function changeImg is defined inside the document ready function. So outside of the document ready it's not accessible (outside of the scope of this function). 

Rather than using onclick on the element, you can bind a click event to the arrows inside of the scope of the doc ready.

e.g.

    $('.ion-arrow-left-c').on('click', function() {
        changeImg('left');
    });

There may be better way to accomplish this, but this should get you going in the right direction.

Thank yooou :)
All of them. Just use all of them. Do one page with Zend, build your API with an ancient version of CodeIgniter, make all your forms with Angular, sell everything with the AWS SDK-- because having inventory is for suckers, do the static part that tells people all about you and your site with Joomla, Wordpress should be used for your articles and other similar SEO building pages. Flip a coin when you decide to use React or Angular on a page. For CSS, use varying mixtures of bootstrap styling and fill in the rest with foundation. Your build chain should randomly choose whether it is compiled with compass or libsass your grunt tasks should call gulp streams. Except when your gulp streams are calling your grunt tasks. Don't forget to use a documentation generator like autoduck, you're so edgy.

I just felt like being saucy, best of luck to you. What I think you meant to ask is about your 'stack'. Can't go wrong with basic LAMP even if it isn't what the cool kids are using.
You don't need a framework right now. Focus on plain, vanilla javascript, understand it, understand it well, then maybe, move to a framework.
I would love to do this, But I prefer to stick to something and learn that completely 
You can't build Amazon with javascript. You will need a 'back end', it is hard to be both, a front end and a back end developer. Better to team up with someone so you can specialize-- or you'll wind up like me only kind of sort of good at both.

Obligatory upvote, cake day.
I am pretty good at basic JS. HTML5 , CSS3 JS certified by Microsoft actually. I wanna move from plain vanilla to frameworks.
At the end I was being serious, you can learn the LAMP stack fairly quickly. You are going to need command line access to most easily build something good and secure. LAMP can, if not inherently, accomplish what you want to do. There is a ton of documentation as well as searchable solutions to most if not all the problems you are going to run into.
So you're not a total noob. Do you want to work purely in JS or are you interested in PHP frameworks? For PHP, I've never seen better than [Laravel](http://laravel.com). For JS then Angular 2 or ReactJS would be a good place to start. The debate about the best frameworks is always quite fierce, there's no right answer - only personal preference. To find your preference, I'd say pick a project you'd like to build, then attempt creating it using a few different frameworks. You'll learn a lot about coding in general and also what suits you.
Ill would prefer to stick with JS. I want to make sure that I will be able to create an amazon like experience with it. I was looking at both Angular and React before posting here. Would like to know which one is better for this specific project (also has a good future). 
Maybe nodal, found it the other day, looks cool enough 
You can do that with both, React or Angular. It's preference, really. Try both and see what you like. I personally prefer React because I think it's superior to Angular, but hey, next guy might be bashing me for this. 

They both won't dissappear in the next months.

You'll also need a backend though to save your articles and your orders. That might be the step after your build your static site. As you said you wanted to stay in JS, node JS it is. Depending on the framework (React/Angular) you choose there are full stack starter kits (they're called kits because they use a lot of frameworks / tools) (for React: este.js or react-starter-kit) for both if you search for them, but they most likely all use express. That's like the standard web server used in the node world. You can also just use express and build your own "starter kit" - that'd be even better. This way you get to understand the pieces and tools better.

Hope I gave you some keywords to look for. I don't know any full stack Angular starter kits though, sorry.
Thanks a lot , your comment is very helpful.
There is MEAN stack for angular which I looked into already.
Ill pursue that further. 
Thanks to anybody who voted, total noob when it comes to TS and there doesn't seem to be a clear consensus on which one to use.
ES6 and ES2015 are the same thing.
I got bitten by this recently as well. Started using mandrill a year ago and kept on using it for new client sites I built. Had absolutely no idea they changed the rules (it happened in July 2015)!

Accounts that were started before the change still retain the free 12k/month, but new accounts are on the 2k free total.

You can try mailgun or sendgrid instead, both of which still have 12k free sends per month.

Another thing to be aware of is that all of these systems (including Mandrill now, as of December 2015) require you to do some DNS setup for DKIM and/or SPF. Not a big deal, but might be a gotcha for super basic stuff or learning projects or teaching beginners about HTML forms (which might not even involve a server or domain name ownership).
Personally, I've never used Mandrill but I've used [MailGun](https://www.mailgun.com/) and hopefully that is a viable alternative to you. You can send 10,000 emails per month for free.
They stopped the free 12k/month about 6-8 months ago and is now a $10/month minimum for 24k emails.
Sendgrid is also a viable alternative: https://sendgrid.com/pricing towards the bottom of the page is the free tier
Looks like you'll have to have a paid mailchimp account starting 4/27.

http://blog.mailchimp.com/important-changes-to-mandrill/
that looks like the perfect solution. Thanks for that!
it was really that long ago?
I'm sure i've set up sites with it in the last 6 months... i think

Are they honoring old free accounts?
They have a campaign just for mandrill folks 

https://sendgrid.com/marketing/mandrill-alternative 
I think they are.  Judging by my dashboard it still shows x/12,000 free: https://gyazo.com/96afc8c376d198239e60a03c14be3510
Aw, neither my work email account nor my personal one have their sends anymore. Had both of these accounts since before they switched too.. they're both at 2,000 trial sends only :(
The method itself is not deprecated, but the practice of using it to detect browser features is wrong and should not be used because it's not reliable.
good read here http://www.stucox.com/blog/you-cant-detect-a-touchscreen/
I'm not really detecting features, but just OS. Is it fine to use it to filter out Android, iOS, Windows Phone, BlackBerry OS, etc. from desktop OSes? I guess I'm looking for touchscreens, really; is there a better way. Bear in mind I don't want to detect laptops with touchscreens particularly.

Edit: Is the the article wrong in saying it has been removed from the specification? Also, on the matter of reliability, for my purpose I think it's reliable enough. My target audience is unlikely to change their UA string, and even if the detection misses some devices, the website still works fine.
It's got to be wrong. NavigatorID is there even in the HTML5.1 Working Draft.

Is there a particular reason you're aiming to detect touch? Why not just handle both (mouse and touch)?
From the source:
> Though some browsers may still support it, it is in the process of being dropped. Do not use it in old or new projects. Pages or Web apps using it may break at any time.

I'd say that's a good reason to avoid it.
You could wait for the first touchstart / mousedown event.  Then you'd know.   But really, your request is contridictory. 

> I'm looking for touchscreens ... I don't want to detect laptops with touchscreens

But... those are touchscreens.  What do you really want?


That sounds about right. I have a gallery of images. On touchscreen devices I'd like to hide the clickable desktop arrows for navigation and enable navigation by dragging/swiping on the image.
That doesn't appear to be the case. The earlier statements in that text box are blatantly incorrect, so I would advise scepticism when it comes to the rest. My guess is that the entire page has been marked *deprecated* rather than just the use of the property in detecting browser capabilities, causing a standard, generic deprecation message to be displayed.
Laptops that have touchscreens are definitively touchscreen devices, but their status as such in reality is debatable. Who actually uses the touchscreen when browsing the web? For native touch-optimised UIs and games, perhaps, but when browsing the web people are entirely prepared to use their touchpad/mouse for anything more than scrolling. If someone does decide to use their finger, they can just tap the arrows at either side of the image. I think more confusion would be caused by switching to touch-based input. The touch based input is intended *mostly* for smartphones, anyway.
You should rely on [feature detection](https://modernizr.com/) rather than tying functionality to the user agent string.
Fair point. It is a blanket label. That being said, I shy away from potentially deprecated features, especially in JS or web apps. Can't say I know a good alternative offhand though. Sorry.
I mostly use my touchscreen on my "laptop". (surface pro)

Why not allow anyone supporting touch events to use touch gestures?
I agree with you. Girlfriend has a Surface Pro and we often use that in tablet mode when lying in bed - it's surprisingly pleasant.
Your solution is not optimal, it uses 100% of my chromes thread on a 4.2GHz CPU and has like 2 FPS when scrolling. I think you have to come up with another solution because this is going to consume a lot of battery on mobile/tablet devices.

From WebKit Wiki:
> Sometimes it's tempting to use webkit's drawing features, like -webkit-gradient, when it's not actually necessary - maintaining images and dealing with Photoshop and drawing tools can be a hassle. However, using CSS for those tasks moves that hassle from the designer's computer to the target's CPU. Gradients, shadows, and other decorations in CSS should be used only when necessary (e.g. when the shape is dynamic based on the content) - otherwise, static images are always faster. On very low-end platforms, it's even advised to use static images for some of the text if possible.

EDIT: To add more value to my response, could you perhaps instead dynamically add the blurred overlay to an image using something like [ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php) or if your images are static, just add the blur directly onto the image?
Why not just use a CSS filter? Then thow the job to the GPU using the 3D translate hack?
https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/f/filter/
https://davidwalsh.name/translate3d
I make extreme use of css filters in [preorda.in](https://preorda.in/sets), they will peg users' cpus unless you throw in a tiny hack.

    transform: translate3d(0.0,0.0,0.0);

This moves all the rendering of that specific element over to the gpu. This makes the gallery I linked, at ~200 blurred images, sit at 60fps rather than being an unusable blackhole of cycles.

There are some visual issues such as stacking context or edge 'artifacts' that appear when you switch over to gpu rendering, but both are trivially fixable with tweaks.
I had to pop htop and kill firefox.
There is an upcoming spec for it in CSS. backdrop-filter:blur(5px);

It already works for iPhones, so you can tailor web apps / pages to give the more iOS look. Support will hopefully grow soon to chrome (it's still in experimental)
With canvas and JS you can get a snapshot of the window. In theory you could resize it to 10% (to limit computation power), blur the canvas, cache the result and inject it into the page. Beware this solution only works on static webpages, animations won't work (without killing the performance). 

If you don't want to use pretendered images, I'd guess this is the most performant option.
Hiding the text and and then using JS to make it fade in only makes your page appear to load *much* slower. You effectively increased the loading time by about half a second and the perceived loading time takes an even bigger hit.

This is much worse than not merging/minifying CSS and JS.
> Bandwidth management is hugely important

I agree.

>The true challenge comes in trying to create some of the same visual style with no background image to rely on.

This is what SVGs are for. If you really have to get clever with it, use the URL option instead of the baked-in `filter` values.

`filter:url(your-filters.svg#fancy-filter)`
Would SVG be a better solution? [With fill-opacity or similar?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6042550/svg-fill-color-transparency-alpha)
CSS blur or gradient (anything related to Gaussian kernel) isn't used very much because they are extremely expensive (O(nlogn) on GPU, n being blur radius) as long as the implementation is accurate. Apple uses very fast approximation (O(1) on GPU), so your guys probably had good results on Safari; but it's very bad on accurate implementations like Chrome or Firefox.

Currently the only fast AND accurate way to do it ONLINE is to implement a Gaussian approximation in webgl. You can get fast but inaccurate result using canvas, but I guess users wouldn't notice the difference. (Here inaccuracy means treating two very similar images using the canvas method can produce very different blurred results).
Just a heads up, Ghostery blocks the Typekit tracker on your site and [all text disappears](http://imgur.com/gallery/pXLQT7t).
I wouldn't use blurfilter for bg images either, a good backend processor can take care of that and save filesize and client cpu. For imageless bg, have you tried svg? It supports blur and gradients, and should work in more browsers. Not sure about performance, but usually svg is cached as bitmap.
Um, if you google "lazy loading images" you will find that this problem has been solved. :) 
Blur.js, it uses javascript to generate images for the background so you aren't sending images to the client 
Looks like your page is broken. [This](http://i.imgur.com/weOsDzg.png) is all I see in Chromium on Ubuntu 15.10. There doesn't appear to be text anywhere on the page.
Every comment here is bitching about it. Nice job man. It's not perfect, but it's awesome to see something new.
Edited out, I was being a jerk :/
I think most of the CPU usage comes from the blur filter set to 70px. That is a large radius to apply Gaussian blur.
yea that performs like shit. made my mac go hot and the examples load like an old c64 loading screen.
The blur filter is just processor intensive in general. That's why other solutions were developed.
I don't get why this would be a problem unless it's animated. I get smooth scrolling even on my iphone 5c. Something is seriously wrong with your computer if your getting 2 fps from this

On the other hand this effect seems like common knowledge to me, I see this done this way all the time.

Thanks for letting me know man â€“ guys whipped this up in like 30 min. As we mentioned in the post, the point is to *not* use an image so ImageMagick or similar doesn't help for that use case.
^ this is so much better, the OP's is super laggy, I'd never use it.
People should really upvote the already existing solutions.

GPU accelerated filters is the correct and only efficient answer!
This needs to be higher up. OP posted a thought experiment without putting any thought into it.
That's pretty cool. I've been wanting to do that since like 2003. We'd be able to accurately reproduce Windows 7's "Glass" effect finally on the web.
That's a super cool prospective solution. Thanks man!
> With canvas and JS you can get a snapshot of the window.

Firefox has an internal CanvasRenderingContext2D.drawWindow method, but you can't use it on the web and it also isn't supported by any other browser.

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/drawWindow
Also with JS disabled you don't see the text because of `p {opacity: 0}`. I'm guessing they're fading in the text for bells & whistles but IMHO the ROI is negative.

Also you can achieve this effect with CSS Animations.
Thanks. As far as we know there's nothing we can do - can only be fixed by users allowing TK via the Ghostery options settings.
Ghostery is blocking all the things. Typekit, Gravatar, etc. Nothing we can fix globally unfortunately.
It's not new. Type "CSS blur" into Google. 
Thanks man â€“ appreciate that. Just a fun proof-of-concept â€“ definitely not perfect!
Haven't you ever been excited when you figured something out for yourself? Granted I have seen Paperleaf linked a lot lately on reddit, but isn't that the point of Reddit is to share things? Would you feel differently if they just linked the Codepens directly and not put a link to their site?  

If you think their CSS is incorrect, then why don't you take this chance to help better them and yourself by helping them come to a better conclusion with their code?  

We should all be working as a community to better each other, not fight each other just because someone is linking their agency's blog.
Thanks, maybe we'll play with that a bit!
this!

70px... lol yeah. that's intense.
I think the blur could be simulated to a good degree by just using more points on the gradient... that's probably much less computation-heavy.
You are right in a sense, the issue is only with Google Chrome on Windows for some reason. IE Edge render perfectly fine. I couldn't even see the cat on Chrome
Oh I thought you were using an image as a background and wanted to overlay that with a blurred CSS? I don't mean to use *another* image for the blurred overlay, I meant to add the blurred overlay to the image itself using ImageMagick, so in the end it's 1 file and smaller file-size than your original image (blurring reduces file-size).
I get that you don't want to use an image but I tried this once and it killed performance. I ended up using images again, way better. It is exactly the same reason why some video games use pre-baked lighting. 
I'm not very good at javascript/css (learning), however I used to be good at flash. A good old flash trick is to cache generated stuff (vector art etc) to offload the cpu. This can be used for all kinds of generated stuff so it should be worth your time looking into a script that does this. Blur it once, cache the blurred version and then show the cached image. Not sure how this would be implemented with js/css though. Edit, no issues running on chrome/win10 so my suggestion might be useless :P Nice effect :)
You seem to be a bit weird. We get that the use case is to have a high performing interface. Bandwidth must be reduced. On the other hand you're probably building it for a user, which will leave imperfect, slow sites. 
So get a proper CDN with proper caching, compress that image and there you go. 
In that case they also support element() als a background property, making it super-super easy to â€˜mirrorâ€™ the dom real time and apply effects with css. 

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/element
That's exactly why I have a noscript class on my html. Before the css loads, I use inline JS to remove the class attribute on the documentElement. Then I can catch .noscript styling in my css-file.
Just remove the opacity property from the paragraph and header tags in the CSS. Currently, it looks like:

    h1, h2, h3, h4, h5{
        opacity: 0;
    }

    p{
        opacity: 0;
    }

The text shows up when the script is loaded because the script then sets it to 1, which is the default. 

If there is a reason why you want to hide the text before the script loads, then at least have some inline javascript in the main HTML that waits a few seconds, then sets the opacity to 1 regardless. That way you have a fallback if the script fails to load.

But really, I would just not hide the text in the first place. There are plenty of people who browse without JavaScript enabled.
about a year and a half ago I was playing around in NW.js and trying things I knew I couldn't anywhere else because other browsers didn't support the features yet. I made it so when you clicked on a modal the `-webkit-filter` would dim the background, desaturate it, lower the contrast, and apply a blur. But it also used a CSS transition to animate the effect in and out (when closing the modal). Holy shit did that eat up some CPU, I was getting like 3 FPS on the animation. Choppy as hell. In about 3 years, when it's safe to use these effects because all browsers will support them, and modern computers will be powerful enough to handle this stuff, it's gonna happen all over the place and murder phone CPU's and batteries because people are dumb and will put this in production.
theres a cat???

first browser: safari 9.0.2
second: newest stable chrome on a windows 7 vm, still no cat

i had to open ie11 to see the cat
There are two examples in the post: first one uses only CSS, no cat background image. Second example uses a cat background image.

The whole point was to not use a background image, and get the same effect. We just added in a second version that uses an image to support that method too.
[deleted]
Well as OP wants to do this dynamically and not based on resources found on the server, you'd have to render the image on the users' end and store it in local storage. Not impossible at all, but it might take a second or two and that shit stacks.
Thanks man â€“ I'll pass this on to the dev team!

In theory, you could pass it to the client side if you used WebGL shader code to generate the effect instead. Massively overkill for this particular effect, but if you had reason to do massive multi-operation can't-be-done-using-CSS-filters image manipulation on the client side that's about the only way to go.

At least, until we finally get custom CSS filters.
Yes it must be done client side and of course make sure to free up memory as soon as the image is not used anymore.
sorry if you misunderstood. formatting messed up and it doesnt make any sense.

on both safari on osx and chrome on windows, the second example (the one with the cat)[ looks like this](http://imgur.com/nnBYZmy)
spot the cat!
Weird, only the pure CSS image (the one *without* the background image) displays like that on my Chrome; on the second image (one with a background) you can at least see the red flower pot color blur behind it.

In reading their text carefully, I don't see them claiming undue significance, and they're fairly clear about what kind of data is used to reach their conclusions. Having "no confidence" seems a bit overkill.

I swear I tried this before but it didn't work... but it is now. Thank you! Do you know why the syntax is like that? It's not like that in the docs on the website. 
Honestly, I barely understand Gulp and Browsersync syntax. I just compared my gulpfile (which is heavily modified from who knows what source) to yours and posted here.
You mean something like [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/)?
Depends on the language and needs. What are yours for both cases?
I modified this: https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate and created my own repo. Then I just cd to an empty folder and git clone it.
Well, for something simple as that I'd use the Terminal:

    mkdir ~/dev/project && cd $_
    touch index.html
    touch main.css
    touch main.js
Yeoman is cool, but I don't see the point in using it every time since you will inevitably have some preferences that don't perfectly fit Yeoman.. So I just have a couple of "boilerplate" repositories set up on bitbucket that I clone whenever I start a project. Maybe some of them started from a modified version of Yeoman. 
We have written our own: http://github.com/kreativgebiet/kickup

Featuring:
- Gulp.js
- ES6 (Babel)
- Scss
- file-include (HTML partials)
something like Yeoman, but not an overkill.
That was my first thought but I think OP doesn't want empty files. I think they're looking for like a Yeoman generator or a script of some sort. 
It's not hard to write your own Yeoman generator if the existing ones don't meet your needs.
I don't think Yeoman is overkill for this, although particular generators might be. If you can't find one you like, write one - it's not hard.
> If you can't find one you like, write one - it's not hard.

Hmm... you got a link on how to do one?
http://yeoman.io/authoring/ - they actually created a Yeoman generator that generates a boilerplate to get you started as well, and this tutorial covers using it.
>someone in IT that works on projects

These are two different things
How so? Web dev's are not considered to be working in the Information Technology field?
As someone who managed a IT change management/project management system and is now organizing web projects, they are different as they have different needs and audit requirements.

>Web dev's are not considered to be working in the Information Technology field?

Depends on the company and situation.

Looking at a recruiting site, developers are listed under Creative not Information Technology. 
Sounds like they either overrode your CNAME so their web server can handle redirect, or they set the server headers such that it tells the browser that anything on *.domain.com must use HTTPS.

If you PM me the domain name and subdomain name I can take a look and suggest how to deal with it correctly.
For anyone else curious, it turns out the host set the HSTS server header on the root domain and included subdomains, forcing any *.domain.com address to redirect to HTTPS when accessed by HTTP.

Due to the subdomains going to other servers, one which doesn't support HTTPS, and one which uses a non-standard port number, most browsers fail to load those sites.

The simplest solution I can think of right now is to change one of the subdomains to load a landing page with the sole purpose of redirecting to the other domain on non-standard port, and adding HTTPS support to the other subdomain that CNAMEs to a dyndns address.
You don't need a framework to do templating. Remember that PHP *is* a templating language, and you can write out template-like files such as this:

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    ... <!-- you know how it goes -->
    <body>
    <?php echo $myvar ?>
    <?php foreach ($stuff as $thing): ?>
    <span>
        <?php echo $thing ?>
    </span>
    <?php endforeach ?>
    </body>
    </html>

Then you can just use an include statement to grab it:

    <?php
    function render() {
        $myvar = 'xyzzy';
        $stuff = ['thing', 'other thing', 'third thing'];
        return include template.php;
    }

A bit crude, yet effective.
Typically, you want to be as [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) as possible.  Generally speaking, you want to look at templating in one form or another to maximize reusability and minimize future maintenance efforts.  You also typically want some separation between your display layer and the logic that is preparing the underlying data for display.

What you're doing is probably fine for very small projects, but you probably want to look towards a more organized, templated approach for anything you expect to be long-lasting and/or anything larger in scale than a fairly small application.

To clarify:  There will certainly be places where you need to loop on the creation of repeated content, but you would likely benefit from separation between the template snippet that defines the display structure of that data from the actual code processing the data and looping on the records.
Take a look at [XHP](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/XHP). The problem with string concatenation for generating html is that it's real easy to fuck up. XHP makes markup semantically a part of the language, which gives you error checking, XSS handling, etc. It's a very similar philosophy to React; React builds on this by also handling state.
I very rarely concatenate markup into a string, I just spit it out as the file executes.  If I need to, I'll use an output buffer.

That being said, I try to separate execution logic and output into dedicated files.
There are a couple of flavors of .asp.

Classic .asp - its very similar to php without any frameworks.  Back in the old days, we'd use .asp to build entire ginormous websites.  If this is what your boss is familiar with then he should have no trouble with the php example /u/deains posted.

ASP.NET Webforms - the next iteration of .asp and the first bit with .NET.  That can use lots of goofy templates.  The 'asp code' was in a separate file from the html/.aspx files.  (I was never really a fan of ASP.NET webforms.)  Maybe this is what your boss is thinking of?  

ASP.NET MVC - this is the latest and greatest.  It uses Razor as the common templating language.  Its current, so my guess is your boss is more familiar with one of the other two.
> how do you typically generate your output?

Depends on the project.  Am I cranking out something quick and dirty?  Then I'll do some simple approach like /u/deains posted.

Is it something elaborate that will grow and have lots of users?  Then a framework is a good idea; many have a particular way of dealing with templates.

Lately, I've been doing a lot of stuff where php or asp.net mvc runs the back end and serves a mostly empty page with JSON data inside a <script>.  jQuery, javascript, mustache then pull an html template from somewhere, manipulate the data according to the users needs, populate the template, and then display it.  Its working pretty nicely actually.  (The next step would be to do the same thing, but use ReactJS.)
In general if your code does something like this:

    $html = "<p>" . $var . "</p>";
    echo $html;

Then you are doing it wrong.

The example posted by https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/3zg26n/do_you_create_html_in_your_php/cylv7t0

is a lot better because that is how PHP was originally meant to be used, as a templating language, PHP code inside HTML.

What a lot of people did is that they wanted to write more complex PHP code and started to output HTML from their PHP functions by either using echo or returning it as strings and then echoing it.

Why is this bad? It puts the design of your page all over your code. 

Say I have some code that can have an error occur and I want to output that error message on the page.

    function doThis() {
    if($error) {
    $html = "<p style='color: red'>" . $error . "</p>";
    echo $html;
    }
    }

Now you need an API that calls this function. Oops, your JSON or XML output suddenly gets messed up if there is an error.

Say your designer wants to change how the error messages look. I used the inline CSS for a reason, it is the same kind of wrong. 

In general, templating is a more robust way to mix your code with HTML. If I see code with a lot of html being created in function, in general I think that developer missed the point. Yes, endless PHP code inside HTML can be confusing, separating code into HTML and PHP is the answer. Not moving the HTML to the PHP.

I use the API idea a lot to check myself. Just see HTML/JSON/XML as different display formats. Can your code easily switch output without having to go in business logic?

How long would it take you to change your website not to generate a HTML page but a JSON string? If such an exercise is trivial, then you have a good separation of display and logic. 

There was a trend for a while where you had HTML creators in PHP and you would have function calls like $form->select($name, $options); echo $form and this would then spit out the HTML for the form. It "worked" but made it extremely difficult to use a different select. Templating with say Smarty or Twig or raw PHP is in my opinion better. 

Leave the HTML to the designers, you just give them data they can then display as they want.

If it's a bigger project you should consider using a template engine. I used twig before and it isn't all to hard to implement but has the advantage of splitting layout/design from logic and data

Which template engine you use is up to you and depends on your project. Twig seems great for a first template language
The only other option is to write the loop in your logic.php file and build the table as a string there and then, in your template.php, just echo $table. But then, there's the problem that you would be polluting your logic.php file with html code.
Your code does not do what I think you think it does. (Or maybe it is doing what you intended but in that case I'd argue that you are writing code that is misleading to others).

The "return" statement does not actually return anything because the contents of your included file is just echo'ing. If you wanted to "capture" the echo'd output of the included file, you'd need to use output buffering, like so:

    ob_start();
    include 'template.php';
    return ob_get_clean();

(Also note that you need quotes around the template file name)
I've done similar stuff but never used include like that. I'm going to have to explore that a bit more, lol

What does the return do in your example?
I've used a similar approach to this when I used PHP frameworks. Usually returning the template(s) when a controller has to run.

I usually returned the template when the destructor was called, but that was five years ago and still not sure if this would be a good practice or not.
So that is pretty much what I'm doing. These aren't anything very large scale, but I keep the data side separate from the display side. My data side does all the queries and database magic. And this is where the small to mid scale comes into play, My logic layer and display layer are merged. I could create a separate display layer, but for all practical purposes, what I'm working on, it would be overkill.

I've never seen DRY spelled out like that. It's essentially everything I aim for while programming. I've always been told to keep that as a priority in one form or another, just never heard it put so straight forward before.
> <?php echo $thing ?>

Echo can be shorthanded to <?= $thing ?> if that floats your boat.
'return' ends the function and would pass the result of the completed template.php back to wherever the function was called.
>  but I keep the data side separate from the display side.

Sounds like ASP.NET Webforms I was talking about.
That is a boat that should be allowed to sink like a stone...it's as annoying as "bae" as a shorthand for "babe". Type out `echo` in full every time for crying out loud! :)
Why...? It is easier to read and type the shorthand, and unlike PHP shortcode (<? ?>), it is widely supported.
I'd look into using something like Wordpress - you can likely find plugins to handle the various elements you're looking for (i.e. event calendar) - and there's a lot of resources you can use if you need help. 
If you do choose to go with WordPress, I've made this [handy little guide](http://www.taniarascia.com/developing-a-wordpress-theme-from-scratch/) that will show you how to set up the environment for WordPress and install it, as well as making a basic theme.

That being said, if this is your first website ever, I would just make it in static HTML and CSS, perhaps using Bootstrap ([handy getting started guide for Bootstrap](http://www.taniarascia.com/what-is-bootstrap-and-how-do-i-use-it/)) if you want.

Whatever you do, don't overcomplicate it. A lot of words and programs and concepts and languages will get thrown at you - Jekyll, Grunt, Gulp, Sass, Bootstrap, PHP, Ruby, Python, CMS, Node.js - but really you need to start with HTML, CSS, and perhaps JavaScript, and get a host, and upload your files, and go from there.
I agree about using WordPress. I would add that you should build it on WordPress.com.

As a nonprofit board member, I know that every dime counts. A beginning WordPress.com site is free. 

Building there also means the software is already loaded and ready to go. Posting entries will get distributed to categories that are relevant to your organization and therefore may reach people who have an interest in what you do.

Once you have some experience with maintaining such a site, you can move it to a new host or upgrade on WordPress.com to a paid account. You also can get a domain name.
1. It may be worthwhile to use Bootstrap (you can override the styles, but many of the layouts will be very helpful) or equivalent (Foundation, etc.), even if for no other reason than having a handy grid with some pre-built components. It'll look a little generic without you bringing in your own assets (images, etc.), but it'll also look consistent and be much faster to build than if you started completely from scratch. It'll also help you make the site mobile-friendly.
2. Do one page at a time, one component at a time.
3. Figure out what content you need on each page (and inside each component on the page) early. The exact content needs will probably change, but start with some definition. This will make design easier.
4. Don't be afraid to copy (at least in spirit) other non-profit websites. Don't copy the exact look, of course, but if you like how they lay out their information, do something similar.

One decision you'll need to make is whether you want to make a static site (HTML, CSS, Javascript), or use something else that ultimately generates HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

If you know that your content isn't going to change much, building a truly static site is probably fine for right now. You'll still be able to change content at will... it'll just require you to open up your editor and change the HTML.

Another option is to use a static site generator, like Jekyll. These ask you to create templates and pages (often in Markdown), which it then compiles to static HTML. I use Jekyll for my professional site, and my students use it for their blogs. The big benefit is that you can write much of your context in markdown (which looks like plain text). These are good if you have a little bit of content that needs to be easily changeable, and a lot of content that's going to stay the same, AND if you don't mind getting your hands dirty.

Another option still is to use Wordpress (or another CMS, but Wordpress is the most common choice). You can create custom themes, and it offers a nice content management system for making it really easy for even non-technical staff to change the contents on a page. About a third of my consulting work is with clients (mostly nonprofits) who want a place to put their information and marketing materials -- we use Wordpress for this most frequently.

There are also convenient work-arounds. For example: your event calendar can just be an embedded google calendar (this works even in static html, though it's not pretty), and your application can be a link to a google or wufoo form. These are less sophisticated than what you'd get if you used a series of wordpress plugins, but they're also fast and cheap and good enough for right now (in many cases).

Were it me, I'd do more evaluating of what the exact needs of this site are (both in terms of content and functionality), and then I'd probably end up using Wordpress along with Bootstrap or Foundation assets as a starter theme. Wordpress uses PHP templates, which look a lot like HTML but have some placeholders for dynamic content.

If I weren't already comfortable with Wordpress, I'd probably use Jekyll. Were I not comfortable with that, I'd hand-generate the HTML and make a note that I should learn something a little more powerful before too long.

(The nice thing about starting with HTML is that you'll have to write that HTML anyways someday if you want to move to a more powerful solution, so even if it's tedious at first that work isn't wasted.)

Hope this helps!
I second this. With more experience and know-how then I'd say do it yourself. However as your first website, you're going to struggle. 

Wordpress will do all the stuff you mentioned, and technically you don't actually need to write code.
I agree. You can use plugins for easy functionality and even use a premade theme if you want to spend some time getting to know the WordPress admin area. 
Apparently we're now too lazy to click the refresh button ourselves. 
Good point.
Use Letsencrypt 

https://letsencrypt.org/
A development setup? About 10 minutes extra to create a self-signed cert and update the virtual host details

Guide on how to create the cert
https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-ssl-certificate-on-apache-for-ubuntu-14-04

Installing the cert (Apache)
https://www.sslshopper.com/article-how-to-create-and-install-an-apache-self-signed-certificate.html
Personally.. I get a letsencrypt cert for development.domain.com in about 30 seconds and it's done.
That's half an hour for me, I have done it. Thing is not too complicated but plenty of places to screw over with what goes where. And then Chrome hates the self-signed certificate, and then it hates me.
Self-signed certificates can cause issues with CORS (and produce the nasty "Error code: sec_error_unknown_issuer").
https://development.domain.com ? Whoahdude.
Interesting! I didn't know that. Can the CORS issue be solved by using a private CA certificate that is added to the cert store?


You're absolutely correct. I spent a lot of hours one night trying to figure out why Chromes preflight was hanging.
Why not?
Yep, but you'll have to add it manually into every friggin Firefox (this browser has its own cert store).

If you devs can handle that, it'll spare you the hassle of using StartSSL (with a painful PKI) or LetsEncrypt (that requires you expose your web server to deliver your TLS certs on demand).

I mean as in "You got a name on domain.com? Holy fuck man that's awesome!".
This is really cool... I'm also curious to know what level is considered "beginner" across projects. Thanks for sharing! 
This is... really *really* cool. I've always loved open source software, and I've been feeling a personal drive to start contributing for about a year now, I just never could find a good place to start.

I'm going to sift through these javascript projects and choose one to do by the end of the night. I hope this is just the beginning, but either way, thank you for posting this!
Hey look it's Emby! boy do I love that app. Super excited to think that it might get even MORE features. (basically it's a similar concept to Plex if anyone has ever used that, I have both and I personally prefer the amount of control Emby gives you over your own server)
I think as a beginner it's better to start your own project. It may serve as a learning guide.
I think the best thing to do is to report the dodgy advert to the advertising platform you're using.

Ultimately the big ad platforms can't thoroughly vet every single advert that gets submitted to them on every single browser and some will slip through, but most of them have a means of reporting them. For instance, [Google provide reporting forms to report dodgy ads submitted to them](https://www.google.co.uk/intl/en-GB/goodtoknow/online-safety/reporting-abuse/). 
I just loaded your site, whatever that ad system is doing, it's seems sketchy, it's constantly loading assets into the browser, so much so that on mobile size it choked my chrome browser. Something doesn't seems fishy here and you should look into it, it's not just a mobile issue.
It's just an animated GIF.

If you right click the image and click "Inspect Element" (in Chrome or Firefox) it will highlight the element. In this case it's a div with the image as a background.
It was made with an app called Recordit

I don't know what screen recording software they used, just want to point out that there is no such thing as a "gifv" and that mp4s can be converted to gifs.

It's simply a gif: https://www.digitalocean.com/assets/images/create-droplet-v5-e512defa.gif

They probably recorded it with a recording software and converted the video to a gif. Most recording software allow to hightlight or replace the cursor so it is better visible. But just from seeing the replaced cursor you can't say which software this is (may also be a custom cursor replacement to match their corporate identity in videos).
Right, I see that. I'm wondering how they produced said GIF. Thanks though!

A quick search turned up [this](https://gist.github.com/eholk/0115691987090973cefe) using the Web Audio API. Explanation on use [here](http://blog.theincredibleholk.org/blog/2014/06/23/generating-morse-code-with-javascript/).
I'm sure there's something out there, but I'll write you something. I'll do it in a CodePen. You can save pens on there with unique urls that can be linked... I'll link the url in a bit here...

*Here's what I came up with: http://codepen.io/ForScale/pen/KVabZq. Here's a unique url not tied to my CodePen account: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/Nxdemg. The CSS (styling) is sparse. The whole thing could be made a lot neater looking!
you want to display the morse "characters"? of course that's possible and it's easy. all you have to do is to split your input into single characters and replace them by the matching morse code. assumed "SOS" was your input your function should return "* * * - - - * * *"
Depends on your setup.  The brunt of your actions will be handled on the server side.  Will you use JavaScript with that?  I would imagine you would then need two database setups that can map English Letters to their morse output.  Theoretically it is possible, but will require some work.  I would be interested in seeing your process though.
don't forget punctuation!

      ".": "._._._", 
      ",": "__..__",
      ":": "___...",
      "?": "..__..", 
      "'": ".____.", 
      "-": "_...._", 
      "/": "_.._.",  
      "(": "_.__.",  
      ")": "_.__._", 
      "\"": "._.._.", 
      "@": ".__._.",
      "=": "_..._",   
      "&": "._...", 
      ";": "_._._.", 
      "+": "._._.",
      "_": "..__._", 
      "$": "..._.._",
      "!": "_._.__"
You're a legend. Here's the bones of what I have so far with some jQuery thrown in:
http://codepen.io/anon/pen/RrKOLX

Let me know if I've done something silly, but the conversion to lowercase doesn't seem to work.

I'd also like to put forward slashes instead of spaces in the output, is this achievable?

Thanks again!
Indeed! Split all the characters! Apply morse and done! 

After that you could implement this awesome morse.js 

https://github.com/mattt/Morse.js/blob/master/README.markdown
There's absolutely no need for a database, nor to process this serverside at all.

Morse code is a simple lookup table of character to it's dot-dash designation that is an international standard. You'd need an object that will never change of what, 55 letters, numbers and punctuation marks and their dot-dash values that are no longer than 6 characters.

Take the input string, split it, loop through and print the dot-dash value of the object with the corresponding key. easy peasy.
Oh... nice! 

Implemented: http://codepen.io/ForScale/pen/KVabZq
Lol, thanks!

Hmm... seems to work for me... I don't like jQuery all that much though, I prefer to code in pure js. Here's an update that has slashes instead of spaces, as well as the ability to handle some special characters and punctuation: http://codepen.io/ForScale/pen/KVabZq
Oh, man! Thanks for the gold... I had just run out!

Glad to help; have a great one! :)
kind of excessive if all that's needed is text -> dot-dash strings and audio isn't needed yeah? an object with 55 attributes will cover every letter, number, and punctuation in the international standard.
Ahh good point.  I was thinking to take the processing off the browser and let a server implementation handle it, but I was thinking a little too far out and trying to over complicate it...my bad.  Thanks for the correction.
I think Github is a very good example.
Digital Ocean. Never been so easy to setup a VPS.
Good UX is tailored to the audience, so if you're asking for something universally good, I think wikipedia is a great example.
I really like Mailchimp, Airbnb and Squarespace. To really get a good sense of their UI/UX you need to make accounts on these sites though.
There's a lot of terrible things about Google's UX/UI (analytics sign-in, I'm looking at you), but for the most part, searches on every platform are the gold standard IMHO. GMail is also pretty good.

Amazon is pretty nice as well, and I've found the Microsoft store...well, it's gotten better, though it could still use a few tweaks (though anything else involving Microsoft is kinda a disaster; how many times do I need to sign in so I can download Visual Studio?)

NewEgg is pretty on par with Amazon as well, though it could be a bit more responsive for desktop. Steam is doing very well, IMHO.

I feel like Lowes is pretty good; better than Home Depot. Sprint was pretty good until their redesign a year or two ago.

But generally, it's harder to define good UX than bad. If shit isn't working right, you know it's not working right. If it could be working better, well, that's kinda subjective depending on what you're doing. I generally base my opinion on a few things: 1) how easy is it to find a menu, 2) how easy is it to find a search box, and 3) how easy is it to read the content on the a) home/splash page and b) a detail/product page and c) a search result. If literally any user can figure that stuff out, they'll probably stick around for a minute or two.
I think the WordPress admin does a pretty good job, all feelings about WordPress itself aside. I also think HubSpot has a fairly nice UI if you ever get a chance to look at it (it's outlandishly expensive software as a service ). 
You should also post this in /r/web_design and /r/frontend to see different results!
I've seen compliments towards https://www.gov.uk/
The websites of Uber and Lyft have pretty decent UX.
I haven't visited this site much (did a bit of holiday browsing in December), but I am very happy with the desktop and mobile site: https://www.sportsexperts.ca/    
Slack have done an amazing job - unfortunately it's another service you have to sign up to to get the full view. The web version of their apps looks and feels exactly like the apps themselves, and is just so easy and intuitive to use. I believe it's brilliant UX that has enabled them to kill email.

A good PHP library: https://github.com/thephpleague/csv

Assuming you know some programming it shouldn't be too hard to parse the data and loop through the rows checking for problems.
Was going to mention league/csv as well!  If your dataset is large, be sure to stream the data, not try to get the whole thing into memory. If you try to load the whole thing into memory and run a basic `foreach` on it, you'll end up exceeding memory limits fairly quickly. 

Also, unless your application is a one-off script, consider to use a data mapper / ORM to search-and-update/insert the data instead of manually crafting SQL queries. It will be more manageable and less prone to "I forgot to update it in that other function" kind of problem moving forward.

I was thinking about this offer too.

I did some googling.  All the programs are on this site for $25:
http://www.infiniteskills.com/

I'm going to sign up and make time and compete all the videos in a few months and then cancel.  That would be cheaper than buying the videos.
Smart move.
Thanks!  FYI its $25 a month.  I left that part off my previous message.
Use glassdoor to get a ballpark figure for the role. When and if your company gives you an offer, you would then have something to negotiate towards. Don't worry too much about whether or not he will "lowball" you -- it's up to you to negotiate what you want. He gives an offer, you give a counter-offer, until you both settle upon a rate that is mutually acceptable.
I'd start applying elsewhere right away. There are plenty of CS jobs in NJ. 
My grandfather always says "the best time to look for a job is when you already have a job". Applying for jobs, and making resumes is something you need to be good at anyway. I would like to add that when I graduated most of my peers had family/friends (mostly parents) that put them up while they searched for their job. At the time I was not afforded this luxury. Because of this I had to jump on the first offer I was extended. Which was not a good one. This put me behind in many ways. While I worked my @$$ off at awful job all of my friends moved in with there parents and spent 6mo-1yr searching for a _good_ job, and they are MUCH better off for it. If that is not an option for you I would say to barter for your best offer and immediately search for other jobs. The worst that could happen is that you will get practice applying and interviewing for jobs. 
In a software company the main cost is salary. It is the company's responsibility to pay you as little as they can get away with. Accept that this is a reality of business and forget about the personal elements such as your loans (they are your problem as far as the company is concerned). They are purely looking at what they pay you vs what they sell your work for. I would guess they will be billing at least $40/50hr for the work they pay you 20/hr.

Negotiating your salary is hard and even more difficult if you are not confident in social situations. I have seen very different salaries for the same role purely because one candidate is too shy to argue their case or even suggest they should be on more.

My tips:

* Timing is important. The best time to ask for a raise is when a big project is about to start and they need to recruit people.
* Do not be overly aggressive and threaten to leave. Doing so shows that you are not committed to the company or job and sets a bad tone for the negotiations.
* Be clear that you know what the market rate is for your experience/skillset and that your replacement would also cost this much.
* Show you are committed to the role and company by explaining what you bring to the company (in cash money terms, not your smooth dance moves at xmas party) and what higher position you would like to work towards.
* Have another job in the pipeline. Being able to say "I have been offered another job somewhere else for more money, but I'd rather stay here" is a great way to say "I like it here but you don't pay me enough". It is up to your morals if that other job exists or not. Your company will find it very hard to prove you actually have an offer.


If you work 40 hours a week at $20 per hour, then you're making about 40k per year. There are 2008 business hours in a year. There's your math.

So becoming full time usually means you'll get benefits through the company. So 40k plus benefits is kind of a raise. But you can probably negotiate higher than 40k even with benefits if they like your work.

Negotiation tactics: 

* Do everything you can to make them say a number first. The person who speaks a number first is at the disadvantage. If they get you to answer "what kind of salary would you like to make?", then you can stop reading now. They got you.
* Don't take the first offer immediately. 90% of the time the initial offer is lower than what their willing to pay you. Say that you'll think about it and get back to them later that day. Call them back later with a counter-offer. Countering their offer will earn you some respect and shows that you put value in yourself.
* Either take their second offer, or politely refuse the position. Their second offer will show you how much they value you. Any further negotiation on your part will sound whiney since you should have completely laid out your case in your first counter offer.
* Stay positive in your negotiation. Use positive words and never criticize their offer like saying it isn't enough. Instead explain why you're worth more. 
* Don't act super excited about the position. It's okay to say you want the position, but saying it's your dream job might be going too far. If they feel you won't go anywhere else, why would they give you more money?
One thing that worries me is that I did not get the chance to apply for jobs yet. So even if I do negotiate, I don't have anything to leverage over it. Do you think I should still continue to negotiate with this in mind?
What was it Wayne Gretzky said, something like _"you miss 100% of the shots you don't take"_? The point of negotiation isn't for you or for him to say _"This is my position, take it or leave it!"_ It's _"this is what I'm looking for, since I have one year of experience...what are you offering? Let's work something out."_ 

Also remember that salary is only one component of a total compensation package. How many days of paid time off are you getting? Can you work from home part of the week? Is there any [pre-tax transit fare benefit](http://web.mta.info/mta/farebenefits.htm) available to you? Are you getting any tuition reimbursement? And so on. Personally, I'm willing to take a bit of a hit on the salary as long as it's still within acceptable, market-rate range (see: Glassdoor, Vault, etc.), if they're willing to let me work from home whenever I want. The slight dip in salary is made up for by my not having to commute three times a week, or what-have-you. 

Forget about that _"I got student loans to pay"_ stuff. Pretty much everyone who went to college in the United States has some amount of student loan debt, so that's not his problem. And forget about that _"it's a small company"_ stuff. That's not really your problem. Your problem is to get the best deal that you can, because you're going to have to live with it for awhile. You may not be asking for Google-level bennies, but you're not expected to be working in a sweatshop either.

You're not going to get fired because you asked for something...and if you do, then that's not a place you want to be working in anyway. Get as good a deal as you possibly can. If at the end of the day you ended up getting shut out on most of what you asked for, then your next step is to update your resume and start looking for another job on the low. Because one of the weird things about life is that it's easier to find a new job while you already are employed.

You get what I'm saying?
Such great advice. Also, I recently read a generality online that said you should start applying for new jobs after you've been at your current one for a year. How long have you been a contractor for this company? Why is your relationship with them changing to full time employment? If your role is changing within the company structure (ie, outside contract we can cut ties with and replace vs. full time employee who we may have been paying and be required to continue paying benefits to), you might want to let the new role settle a bit and then start applying for new jobs.

The applying for new jobs bit is not always about actually taking a new job, but it gives you a way to gauge your value with an outside organization and something to discuss with a current employer.
I'm sure the websites mentioned in the article are aware that these practices are anti-UX, but nearly all of the examples are sacrificing good user-experience for the sake of advertising.

Specifically, forcing the user to engage, or at least view, some sort of advertising is the prerogative here.
European-based websites are required to be law to show that they are using cookies.

source: https://www.cookielaw.org/the-cookie-law/
So true, was trying to acccess Forbes yesterday and they won't even let you get past the quote if you're using ad blocker.
The password one drives me absolutely nuts! If the app is hashing things correctly it shouldn't ever matter how long the data is in a password field! A hashing algo will get it down to a fixed character width anyway. Banks are notoriously terrible in this regard.
> Full screen and popover ads â€“ die a fiery death

LMAO

But yeah Forbes _sucks_.
Paywalls are fine. The snatch-and-grab implementation of the paywall is bad, but the general idea (pay for content) is not.

If you have a paywall, show the first few sentences with an ellipses at the end. Then provide a signup form below.
He's not wrong.  But I could watch a thousand Forbes ads and read another thousand cookie disclaimers before I would want to read a headline with the tired "It's INSERT_CURRENT_YEAR already!" gimmick.  
There is a work around for pretty much any wanky site that tries to block your ad block- Change the referrer. Or just rip the content via the RSS feed.
This site itself has a screwed-up UX.  Is this some meta-level joke?
We used to have this on a regular basis, some of the guys would want "to increase conversion" somewhere and we would fight tooth and nail to not implement and eventually get overruled somewhere else. 

Unfortunately people do click on this crap and thus why it is becoming more prevalent.

Also people don't want to pay for anything and the only way they can make cash is via page clicks and all of the other bullshit.

The screenshot from Forbes is probably a pretty smart way of filtering bots etc that are scraping their content.
Add to the list:  Sites with non-full screen width content and a whole chunk of advertisements taking up most of the damn space.

Closing your article with a question to try to drive user engagement.

Like OP's site.
Forbes is the worst, I haven't read a single Forbes article since it literally locks you out for adblock... now I don't read Forbes or send Forbes links around to anyone... must be a big benefit to them.
Most of these things exist because they convert better than unobtrusive ads.  Yes, the UX is shitty, but it keeps the lights on and keeps devs employed.  Get over it.
I remember [writing a large TxTi about this](http://txti.es/the-current-state-of-website-design-dizzyzane).
lol that site..not sure if that's part of the joke or not.
Reading the part about banks, the guy who wrote this is obviously a front end web developer and not an Analyst Programmer working on a Mainframe.

edit: The rest of the article is 110% my life. Preach it sister!
This guy is incredibly naive as to how the world works
This is the key point in the matter, nothing will change in 2016. UX will still be shit, we'll still have to navigate through a sea of ad's despite our up-to-date version of adblocker or whatever else you feel helps the issue. We shouldn't, but we have to because of companies looking to gain extra revenue, not surprising at all. This article will not help. 
All the websites he referenced are purely designed to make money. These crappy UX tactics make money. Nobody is going to change these things just for the sake of UX. What does Time care that a full screen popover is annoying as fuck? It doesn't drive people away (people X the pop-up, not leave the page completely out of frustration) and it increases sign-ups to their newsletter. None of these websites have any incentive to change. 
The author knows that. The point is that the law is stupid. (Also you don't *really* need to add the banner - you're not gonna get prosecuted unless you're a top 1000 site.)
Just finished the article and he went over that again
I wouldn't say it *never* matters how long a password field can be. I don't deal with passwords in my job (thank goodness), but I've read that it's a good idea to set an upper bound of, like, 1000 characters or something because hashing long strings can get time-expensive and if it's not capped it could be a DoS attack vector.

But, yeah, when you're talking about capping passwords at 20 characters, that's just absurd.
Requiring a number of pre-defined security questions are also annoying. Usually they also make assumptions on the person using the website.
Even with hashing properly, enforcing minimal guidelines makes sense from an account security standpoint, especially length. Allowing users to set the password "1" just sets yourself up for compromised account mitigation down the road.
"16 bad headlines you won't believe you'll read in 2016."
How does changing the referrer help? The ad-blocker detection scripts simply detect whether the ads on the site are showing, and if not give you that message.

The real way to work around them is to turn off JS.
They might also increase bounce rate.
If you read it all, you'd see he makes money from ads, too. He actually blames the full screen ads etc for making more people install adblockers thus bringing down revenue for him.
Should be noted, this article will also not hinder the desired outcome. Didn't want to end on such a negative note. 
In Germany you get sued for not having a valid imprint.

If the first gets sued because of the cookie law you can be sure to get sued in Germany, too.
Agreed. You always have to be cognizant of buffer overflow vectors, but many webserver like nginx and apache let you protect against things like that at a higher level than the code.
Sure for minimum, but things like enforcing maximums like 10 characters, disallow Unicode, etc are just absurd as they significantly decrease the layers of entropy. 
Google it. It's a redirrect scipt that forwards you on to the add/quote from a landing page. You can override the Referrer using an ext like Referrer Control. You don't need to disable JS.
Sure, but if your revenue still goes up most content sites will take the worse traffic and higher revenue.
What are the consequences of non-compliance? How much can you get sued?
OK you never said you were talking about the full page ads.
+1 best thing i've seen on this sub in a long time
I wanted to know whether someone here uses this. The part I liked was:

> As you can see, the backend web application can either respond to an HTTP request normally, or it can respond with holding instructions and send data down the connection at a later time. Either way, the backend never maintains long-lived connections on its own. Instead, it is Pushpinâ€™s job to maintain long-lived connections to clients. HTTP streaming and WebSockets are handled in a similar fashion.

It looks like the monetization plan of the authors of pushpin is to release the code but [charge for a cloud service](https://fanout.io). Which sounds okay, but I also want to understand whether the cloud has some "premium", must-pay feature or if everything is actually open source.
Hi, Fanout person here. Our stance is that Pushpin should be fully functional on its own, and not intentionally limited to cause people to sign up for our cloud service. If you are interested in the proxy approach for building your own API, then Pushpin has everything you need.

The Fanout Cloud has user accounts, a friendly web UI, stats graphs, REST API, and extra protocols like Bayeux. The code for these features are not open source, but they are all out of scope for Pushpin anyway.
I thought the video was very good and as someone who is at the moment trying to build at real-time API for a payment gateway this could be very useful.
Thanks for clarifying!

> REST API,

What is this REST API used for? That's not GRIP, but something else, right?

> extra protocols like Bayeux

Well, that's potentially relevant (perhaps by someone wanting to interoperate with some existing service using Bayeux), since it's still publish/subscriber on top of HTTP. I'm unsure in which sense you classify it as "out of scope".

Does Bayeux provide extra features not covered by Pushpin's own protocol, GRIP? Also, integration with XMPP is also closed, right?

Are there plans to eventually open such integration with external protocols?
But I didn't see any video, in what link?

edit: you mean [this](http://pushpin.org/docs/#video-walkthrough)?
The REST API allows manipulation of unrelated features (e.g. accounts) but also acts as a convenience wrapper around Pushpin for things like subscription events which are normally only available via ZeroMQ. It also adds JWT auth for publish calls.

Pushpin is intended to be client protocol-agnostic, so direct support for Bayeux (or any other client protocol) is considered to be out of scope. GRIP is a backend protocol only so they aren't exactly comparable. But, you could say that since it's possible to create a Bayeux service using GRIP (as we did), then GRIP is at least equally functional.

We don't have any immediate plans to open our Bayeux server code. If people want an open option there's already Faye.

The XMPP integration is closed, but that's primarily for server-to-server connectivity and doesn't involve Pushpin.

Thank you so much for your answer but that just makes the bottom part scroll. It helps but its still on top of the text while scrolling.
You want to move #logo, .main-div, #arrow_left and #arrow_right into an own div with a fixed height. You then want to turn this div into a [sticky footer](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/sticky-footer/).
Should be called VerboseExpressions.
Python can have verbose regex - is this common across most languages? It seems to negate the density when looking back at one as they can have comments next to all the sections. 

from [here](http://www.diveintopython.net/regular_expressions/verbose.html)

Learning this sytax is more work than learning real regex sytax imo, and is definitely MUCH less portable.
For someone that rarely uses regexp this was really cool and helpful.  
Looking forward to using it.
I made a _very very_ crude [codepen playground](http://codepen.io/FranciscoG/full/qbRgjd/) for it.   Just edit the existing sample already there.  

This is a cool tool if you don't want to learn regex and just want to get some regex matching done quick.  But I still think that RegEx is definitely a good thing to learn, it's been incredibly helpful to me and I still feel sort of novice at it. This lib could be a good place to start learning it but just make sure it's not your only tool because it has a very specific output of RegEx which might not always be the best and most legible way.

Take this example, which i got from OP's link:  (everything below will be Javascript's RegEx syntax)

    VerEx()
    	.startOfLine()
    	.then( "http" )
    	.maybe( "s" )
    	.then( "://" )
    	.maybe( "www." )
    	.anythingBut( " " )
    	.endOfLine();

and that outputs this regex: 
   
    /^(?:http)(?:s)?(?:\:\/\/)(?:www\.)?(?:[^\ ]*)$/gm

But you could also write the exact same thing like this (please correct it if I'm wrong or off somewhere)

    /^https?://(www\.)?\S*$/gm

The former is probably easier to output for the developer who made the lib but I feel like the 2nd one is way more legible even to a RegEx beginner.


How would it work with multiple regex groups? Would it even? I think this is more readable, but can't think of how I would go about using it in even small projects with large and diverse datasets.
I was going to comment "please make this for other languages too", then I saw:

Ruby
C#
Python
Java
Groovy
PHP
Haskell
C++
Objective-C
Perl
Swift

Thanks to whoever made this!
The boggling part is regex isn't that hard if you think of it in the exact same way as this library's syntax:

    var validator = VerEx()
                .startOfLine() // /^
                .then( "http" ) // http
                .maybe( "s" ) // s?
                .then( "://" ) // :\/\/
                .maybe( "www." ) // (?:www\.)?
                .anythingBut( " " ) // [^ ]*
                .endOfLine(); // $/

Putting it together: ```/^https?:\/\/(?:www\.)?[^ ]*$/```

The syntax of Regex isn't that arcane and you can use sites like regexr.com to give examples for each verb you may need.

Use less code; use clean readable regex :)

This... this is so beautiful! This fits better with how I think and code! I know some people (a *lot* of people, based on other comments in this thread) don't find regex that hard, but the 4-5 times a year I have to use it, I find it maddening. (Admission: That's probably *because* I only use it 4-5 times a year. But still.)

Thanks for sharing this!
Great, another form of regex. IMO we need to have 1 standard for regex. Instead we have 

* Javascript regex
* Grep regex
* Perl regex
* Editor specific regex
* Java regex

Etc


I don't even know how these are different. I always have to look it up when I'm writing it. Maybe some of these are identical. I don't even know.

I don't like this idea. Sorry. We enough versions of regex as it is.
Shameless plug for a complementary tool I'm working on: [sane-regexp.js](http://github.com/pygy/sane-regexp.js).

When this regexp that matches braces in a JS-like language, skipping those in comments and strings

    /(?:(['"`])(?:(?:\\\1|\\\\|(?!\1)[\s\S]))*\1|\/\*(?:(?!\*\/)[\s\S])*\*\/|\/\/[^\n]*\n|((?:[{}]|\}\})))/gm

is written 

    flags('gm',
        either(
            sequence(
                capture(/['"`]/),
                greedy('*', // a greedy zero-or-more repetition
                    either(
                        sequence('\\', ref(1)),
                        '\\\\',
                        sequence(avoid(ref(1)), /[\s\S]/)
                    )
                ),
                ref(1)
            ),
            sequence(
                '/*',
                greedy('*',
                    avoid('*/'),
                    /[\s\S]/
                ),
                '*/'
            ),
            sequence('//', /[^\n]*\n/),
            capture(either(/[{}]/, '}}'))
        )
    );
Cool gadget :)

I like the concept but it is not suitable for most applications. 
My eyes bleed reading that non-monospaced font code :(
.NET supports this too, I prefer it that way.
Yes. This is used a lot in Perl scripting. However you need to set the x flag (just like the global g flag or i for ignore-case) so it ignores whitespace and accepts comments.
But it's much more readable.

The biggest problem with Regex is that it's extremely hard to parse for anyone else other than you, or even by you a few weeks later. It's basically like trying to read minified code. It's possible, but you just gotta stare at it for 5 minutes.

Sure I know it's possible to make nicely spaced and commentated regexes, but this makes it much easier.

Also, since this is basically just creating a Regex behind the scene, wouldn't it possible to convert the VerEx into a regex at build time?
The problem I have with regex is that I only have to use it every couple of months, and because the syntax is so unmemorable each time I pretty much have to start from scratch. Other things that I use rarely but actual names and functions stick in my head. 

This is maybe no easier to learn than regex, but a month later I'd still remember it.
I'm spent a little time looking at learning regex, but it always seems so complicated... Versus the alternative of just googling for the regex that i want. 

Anyone know of a really good tutorial that makes it easy to understand? 

I kinda wish there was a tool similar to what this library does, but simply converts and prints out that logic into a standard regex string. And alternatively you could post the regex string in and it would spit out the logic. 
>definitely MUCH less portable

The lib is ported to like 20 languages. 
Given PCRE, extended regex, normal regex, JavaScript, etc flavored of regex I think portability is a non-sequitur, as in the portability issue lies with regex and not this library. As for your willingness (or lack of) to learn this library is not the library's responsibility either. 

That aside, any kind of builder like this is a trade off between precisionâ€”sometimes performanceâ€”and ease of use; and consequently, maintainability. This kind of library would also open the door for dynamically building regex based on arbitrary input from any user. 

I personally would find this easier to read than those esoteric expressions for complex logicâ€”assuming that they support the more advanced features of regex (i.e. Look around and recursion to name two). 
Right? I was just about to have a look at how RegEx's work but after discovering this package i'm like "Nah, not yet"
Not sure about multiple groups, there's not really a answer in the API-Documentation.
Brackets are not a way to do grouping. They are for defining character classes. `[www\.]?` is the same as `[w\.]?` which accepts w, a period, or nothing at all.

What you want is parenthesis: `(www\.)?`. Or, better, using non-capturing groups if you don't need to capture them: `(?:www\.)?`

And that applies to this line, too: `.maybe( "s" ) // [s]?` but doesn't have a real consequence there since you could have just done `https?` for it to mean the same thing.

Also, `.anythingBut( " " ) // .*?` is incorrect. I'm not sure what that was supposed to do but I think it's supposed to be `[^ ]*` which captures any number of non-spaces. My final regex would be: `^https?:\/\/(?:www\.)?[^ ]*$`

I think regex is an important tool to learn and I think that this tool is discourages people with distractions but you didn't really do a good job making regex look good. Regex is not clean. It is a concise way to describing the text with parts of the text and some notation.
I agree that regular expressions are not hard, your regex is wrong though :P The squared brackets, the anythingBut and the endOfLine.  More like this: `^https?:\/\/(www\.)?[^ ]*$`

I am not 100% certain what the anythingBut means (sounds like [^ ] without * or +, that would not make sense though), so maybe that differs a bit. The `.maybe( "www." )` is also redundant, since it is already covered by `.anythingBut( " " )`. One way or another, a very bad regex (or verbex for that matter) to match urls.
That's a really simple example, though.
It's just a constructor to create RegEx, not "another form of RegEx"
Oh god! I'm so sorry, will change it tomorrow, actually just noticed this now.
Instead of piping through a bunch of methods, this would be better served as some kind of tool that would output the correct Regex string to use.

Furthermore, does this thing support capture groups?  I don't see anything mentioned on the Github.

Also, http://www.regexr.com/ is awesome.  Grab the MDN document on JS regex and go play with regexr if you want the best way to learn regex.  Unfortunately, I forget a lot of it if I stop using it for a while, but can pick it up after a few minutes.
It is readable for simple expressions, in such cases regular expressions are not hard to read either though. If you try to represent a complex regular expression as verbal expression you would get an unreadable monster as well, simply by its size alone.
Since others are posting links, i personally prefer https://regex101.com to debug my regex
Readability is one thing, but readability comes at the expense of portability and power (I'm assuming, not having looked at the library, but it's unlikely the full power of RegEx is described).

I think wrappers solve an immediate problem ("This looks ugly/minified") while introducing a long-term problem--when you inevitably require something that the library doesn't do, or you need to implement the same RegEx on a different system, or so on.

If you learn RegEx, it becomes fairly easy to write the sort of code described by this library. If you don't know RegEx, I'd argue that you shouldn't be in charge of maintaining it--working via a wrapper is going to lead to bugs where your understanding of the wrapper diverges from the way RegEx works.
I don't know of any tutorial per se, but what really helped me learn was [Regexr](http://www.regexr.com/), it has cheat sheets/examples along with a solid testing area to play around in.

There's also [Regexper](http://regexper.com/#^%28%3F%3Amatch%20this|or%20this%29%20followed%20by%20this%24) which allows you to type in some regex and get a visual representation of it, unfortunately it doesn't do it the other way round, but still pretty useful.
> Anyone know of a really good tutorial that makes it easy to understand?

Give [regexone.com](http://regexone.com/) a try

> And alternatively you could post the regex string in and it would spit out the logic.

That would be sweet!
I second /u/WakeskaterX with [regex101](https://regex101.com/).
Sweet, thanks for the links /u/WakeskaterX , /u/that_griff and /u/orange-lamp
I learned by downloading and reading the documentation of http://www.regexbuddy.com/
Which is nothing compared to regex/ PCRE support.
You should *still* definitely understand how RegEx's work. You will inevitably come across code with it and will need to know how it works.
how about capturing groups? 

reverse look behinds? 

kid, there's a reason why regex hasn't gone away and replaced. quit looking for excuses. I've programmed for ten years and it took the first four to understand it and another two to become comfortable with it. 
That carot as a negator inside the brackets always throws me.  Why isn't it `!`? 

To be fair it was around midnight for me and I was about to pass out ;)

The point is more that if you break a regex in to small pieces, converting it isn't that much of a drama - reading them back out is much the same (and if it's seriously complex or obtuse a comment block would be appropriate anyway)
> I agree that regular expressions are not hard, your regex is wrong though :P 

story of my life  
regex works, hit production and be amazed that __everything__ is a URL

Ah I see. I guess I didn't get that part. 
Haha no worries, man! Digging the Ubuntu font choice all in all, though. It's one of my favorites.
Regex 101 is my go to Regex tester 
RegExr is how I learned to love regex, it is a great tool.
> this would be better served as some kind of tool that would output the correct Regex string to use

This was exactly my thought as soon as I read this. 
> , does this thing support capture groups? I don't se

how about compiling with a gulp task?
Gotta agree to that. However, i've seen a lot of RegEx monsters and i would've heavily prefered a readable way.
Still more readable than the equivalent RegEx string.
[Regex101](https://regex101.com/) is another good one.  I like Regexr for just trying stuff out and getting better at Regex, but I've found regex101 to be more useful for trying to find a very specific match regex in practical applications.
Yeah, came across a lot of RegEx's so far and everytime i'm basically just looking up every part.
Not looking for excuses, just bringing up a Library which helps creating RegEx's. 
I'm pretty aware of the fact i need to learn them.
Aaand it's done! :)
Same. Awesome site. 
Not sure if you meant to quote that part of my comment.  Anything is possible with transpilation, but you could save yourself the trouble of adding a build step, adding a new dependency, learning a new API, and confusing people who actually know RegEx by just making it some kind of tool that lets you describe what you want and outputting the proper regex pattern.  You won't be dependent on the people who created the verbal expressions lib in the event that you run into any issues.  Also, needing to upgrade to the latest version could present breaking changes if they fixed a bug you've encountered after they've made changes to the API as well.

Plus, as I mentioned, I don't see anything about capture groups in the docs.
It's a sign that you should not be using regex for what you are trying to accomplish. 

Not saying "don't use regex", I'm saying "use it wisely".
RegEx monsters, why must you torment me so?
This would be solved by comments in the regex itself.
Awesome!!
[URL Validation Regex of Doom](http://pastebin.com/ea8V69Q0)
Because thats what i do!
holy shit
shit, even if holy, cannot be that complex.

that is some serious crap.
Well defined APIs, good documentation, few extra requirements.
Developer usability is a real thing. Big players do alot of testing in this area. It's about usability of the API, the language, the tools, etc.
That's a hard question. I guess it'd be the ease of implementing and syntax. Curious for a good answer! 
How can I use it to update my resume and look cool.
it also has to make me toast with butter. 
Take Google's approach to Angular 2. Initial reactions to their proposed syntax, migration, and dev tools was very negative. Ultimately, ease of migration, easy to understand syntax and API structure, and provided helpers are all part of the usability of a framework. Google clearly put a lot of time and effort into addressing usability concerns over the last year. 

On the flip side there's Aurelia, which appears to be a very powerful modern framework but suffers from poor documentation and general low transparency into the dev process.
And it should bring you the coffee right to your table, sure. /s
I've never done this but I think it could work

What if you downloaded all the relevant static files (after seeing that it is an angular app) and then ran it as your own angular app, where you could scrape from localhost? The advantage here is that I'm pretty sure you would able to see when it finished loading completely. (though this could give XSS problems)

Considering Nightmare uses Electron (no longer PhantomJS) and is actually pretty fast, I'd say you have a little more research to do. Unfortunately Nightmare is (now that it uses Electron) a bit tricky to use on Linux.
Cant you check what URL is beeing loaded in devtools and scrape that one instead?
> Is there any bulletproof way to scrape content loaded with Angular?

No. What I'd suggest is looking at the requests the Angular site uses to load the data- and make the same requests from *your* application to get the data. This will be much faster and vastly more reliable than scraping.
Ok, so thanks everyone for the help they've given me. I was able to analyze the site's scripts via DevTools > Resources > Frames > Scripts. Once I got in there I found some clues in the comments that led me to discover the API endpoint I needed. Turns out it is publicly accessible and the required parameters are conveniently provided to you on an API miss, so I can get all the data I need quickly in JSON format.

So if you find this thread while trying to scrape an Angular app yourself, dig into the frames section of resources in Developer Tools. Source files will not display themselves fully, there are ways to work around that (debugging endpoints and stuff), but frames can quickly give you some clues for reverse engineering an API. I'm not sure if the API is defined via Angular routes or not (most likely not), so a purely Angular API may still be pose further problems.
Interesting, I don't know how the XSS part would work out, might be worth a shot, because if I can download static content once, literally all that needs to change is the boxscore ID to load another.
That's what I meant to type, I've scraped a few thousand results already with Electron (via Nightmare), I just got mixed up since I've been doing so much reading/Googling. Electron itself is fast, but the process isn't, Nightmare is just too inconsistent, I don't think any problems fall on Electron.
That would be the process for reverse engineering a basic REST API, but Angular is a bit trickier, and not knowing a ton about Angular, I'm not sure how to recreate the necessary HTTP request, and that the server would even accept it.
Would this require loading the page within the browser still? I'm not super familiar with angular, but some frameworks I know use tokens to prevent XSS and stuff. I shouldn't be able to launch a browserless HTTP request and get the data through an Angular controller, correct?
The Angular page you want to scrape is pulling data from a backend service, *somehow*. Maybe they are using tokens, maybe they're not! Analyze the requests the page actually sends, and you may be able to "fake" the backend into thinking your application is the original Angular client you're trying to scrape.
looks cool.

for me, the arrow keys weren't working in chrome on os x 10.11

also, the text is being cut off when you enter 8 characters, http://i.imgur.com/hP912Zx.png
Beautifully done, bookmarked it!
So minimalist, it doesn't even have visual elements. I like it. 
Very nice. It could not any simpler.
I wanted to do this exact thing just now, and I remembered your website and was glad I bookmarked it. :) I love the clean interface.
Feedback? Questions? Oh, and try the arrow keys.
Good job on the site. But how is this any quicker than holding shift and clicking the color in dev tools to cycle through formats?


Off topic, but what does `display: flex;` do, exactly, and what would it be used for?
I tried to enter the names listed [here](http://www.somacon.com/p142.php) and your site didn't work for all of them.
i entered red and now im ded
An aside, I have been using this tool for years. It's great to just have installed. http://colorsnapper.com/. Also great looking site man!
Thanks!

The cutoff should be fixed now.

The only function the arrow keys are supposed to have is that up/down, when the cursor is over a numeric value, increments/decrements. Is that not working?
Thank you, I'm happy to hear it.
Thanks!
Thanks, that's what I was aiming for.
Thanks, I'm happy to hear it!
Looks really nice. I've thought about css colour managers/converters before, mostly because none do exactly what I want.

Here's a couple of features that would make me happy:
- the ability to cache a list of colours, then when clicked pop the hex/rgb/hsl to the pasteboard
- push the chosen colour to the URL with history.pushState

Great job!
Speaking of the arrow keys, when entering a rgb/hsl value it'd be nice if the values were locked into a range in the same way that the hex values are. Otherwise, a really nice tool :)
Well it's not if your goal is to reformat a color you're already looking at in dev tools. The intended use is when you have a color string, eg in a text editor or on the clipboard, and want to change the format. In this case it's a slower to open a new tab, fire up the dev tools (which take longer to load than csscolorconverter.com on my laptop), inspect something, give some attribute the source color, shift-click it, highlight it, and finally get your output.
it turns the current element in to a flexbox container and makes its children flexbox items.
Look at this game for an introduction to Flexbox: http://flexboxfroggy.com/
Others answered your question, just want to add, [this](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) is a resource about flexbox I use often, and in this instance all it's being used for is vertical centering.
Those are actually Behr paint colors. The website should work for all official CSS color names, which you can find enumerated [here](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-color/#named-colors).
Yeah, I discovered I have a tendency to test with "red". It hurt.
Thanks. And that's a neat tool, I'm going to try it out for a while. I've just been using Digital Color Meter.
cutoff is fixed on my end.

the arrow keys are working now. maybe i was doing something wrong before.
Thanks. Would you tell me how you would use these features so I can try to understand what the best solution would be?
Thanks. I agree it'd be better, I'll see what I can do.
Fair point. Most of my workflow lies within the browser so didn't really think of that scenario :)
~~ELI8? :p~~

Nevermind I Googled it. I think this is what I need for my personal website... At the moment I'm using relative position squares for links. Hmm...
Oh my that's great! I'll definitely have a play through that at some point!
You're right. And I learned a few colors in the process, like "burlywood" :)
Sure.

Cache: I would pin your website as a tab in Chrome, then whenever I need a colour, I could quickly switch to it click a block at the bottom of the page with the colour I want then, back to my code and paste. Yes most of the time I use variables to store colours in my Sass, but sometimes when you're working quick and dirty you just want a Hex. More often than not though, I want quick access to 2-12 colours, being able to see the difference between #125796 and #325497 side by side is quite handy.

URL/pushState: Say I need to check with a designer which blue for this button http://www.csscolorconverter.com/125796 or http://www.csscolorconverter.com/325497

Without running away with ideas http://www.csscolorconverter.com/125796/325497 would be even cooler, that would show a comparison of colours side by side.

HTH
Take a look at [can I use](http://caniuse.com/#feat=flexbox), there are troubles with IE (click "known issues"), but Edge supports it.

Another trouble is that some browsers might support the older version of flexbox, from 2009, that wasn't standardized. There's a polyfill, but for the older version (see [this](http://www.planningforaliens.com/blog/2014/03/11/real-world-flexbox/) and [this](http://www.sitepoint.com/are-we-ready-to-use-flexbox/))
I'm sure this isn't what you want to hear, but I don't see those features fitting into the scope of a CSS color format converter. I see the use, but towards the broader goal of a palette manager. Would you not then also want tools for choosing colors, like a color wheel, complement generator, etc? There are already solutions in that area as well, like color.adobe.com. I'm not saying I don't want to implement those features - and I do think I can improve on the UX of existing solutions - but I don't see it fitting into a domain called "csscolorconverter".
Might not be your issue, but facebook has a cache, so if the link has been posted on facebook in the past, it will use the cached version instead of whatever you have in your meta tags now. You can clear the cache here: https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/
Ok, I tried it and the preview that it displays is the cached version (doesn't show my updated og:description text, only the old text).

It's also giving me this error: Objects of this type do not allow properties named 'og:description'

edit:spelling

> 'og:desciption'

FTFY desc**r**iption
you might not be using the right tag/format for meta tags? If you want to post your link, could help.
Fixed it! Spelled 'description' as 'desciption' in the meta tags
lol, that would do it!
I can't help you with this, but I can warn you that depending on what version of Susy you're using, you may end up with an incredibly slow SCSS build step because of it. They have made new progress in newer versions, but I don't think that the new version is stable yet.

I'd recommend using Neat personally.
All good man, I worked it out! Thanks for the suggestion though! 
It's not taboo, any good ORM will still allow you to write your own queries. It just ends up being a shorthand for the things you do over and over. 

Its really just having a model layer that gives you benefits and at that point it's not much more work to add some short hand methods for things like grabbing all the records in a table. In Laravel for example eloquent will fire events for you on most actions that happen on a model so; for example, if you need to do something every time a record is deleted from a table, you already have events for that. 

Also lets say I have an Orders table and a Products table and each order has products, but there is also a product_attribute table or something with eloquent I can get all those by writing `Orders::with('products.attributes')->get();` and that will give me every order along with its products and the attributes as a collection that can be easily converted to JSON (just by returning it). I don't get how you don't see how that's pretty convenient. Overall writing your own queries is more performant.. but sometimes your like lets just get this done in one line.
I'm not a big fan of frameworks also but I often use them in some projects.
The building of queries that way has not much to do with abstraction but more with building queries according to the database system in use. This way you can switch the database engine without having to rewrite queries.
As a new Rails dev, programming has been much more accessible for me than it would've been writing raw SQL. I can tell that just by looking at the type of long SQL statements activerecord spits out when I'm dealing with many to many relationships. 
They're for developer convenience, they're great so long as your data source is within a <1ms round trip.  ORMS tend to produce A LOT of queries and typically create a high amount of meta-data queries on tables which can be expensive as they (in specific narrow cases) can be transactional.

These large amount of queries usually return less than 100 bytes of data and tend to rely on low latency.  If you find a PHP, Java, or .NET app acting slow... 99% of the time its the ORM struggling to push very small (and sometimes expensive) queries through a database.
Ahh ok I can see the advantage to that. 
In addition, for complex queries, chaining model methods is often much cleaner than writing out a big, messy SQL query. 
Someone will certainly point out that Microsoft have open sourced things, but in short, this is asking for trouble. The MS OSS ecosystem is still a moving target, and Visual Studio is still a Windows application.

If you're not totally pro MS, why C#?
C# is a very nice language to use and I am a huge fan of the money that comes along with it.
Actually the latest version of ASP.NET (I'm assuming OP is doing web development) doesn't require visual studio. Much like node, you download a command line tool, write your code in anything (even vim) and then use the command line tool to build/run the code. It comes with a small webserver and It even works on *nix. The ASP.NET team has worked very hard to ensure that the tools are cross platform and linux/mac are top priority. I've built several smaller apps purely on my mac without windows running ASP.NET 5.

For older versions of ASP.NET (4.x) - [MonoDevelop](http://www.monodevelop.com/) works quite on *nix environments. 
I'm not saying it can't be done. I'm saying, if you have to ask, you're going to quite hit a wall around the fact that nearly every attempt at Googling anything will give you an answer that assumes you're in Visual Studio.

Sometimes, just because you can, doesn't make it a good idea.
Well the point I'm making is that for newer stuff, you won't hit a wall because it's really easy to do. 

It might have been difficult in the past, but just because something was hard at some point doesn't mean it can't change and become easier/better. That's exactly the case here.




I cache forecast data in redis, which works well for my use case. Postgres is a nice database and has native support for JSON structures. MySQL is supposed to be getting that as well, not sure how the implementations will compare.
I don't have anything to add that hasn't already been covered here already regarding the storage; however, I wanted to mention that the ToS on may API's disallow storage of the data being returned from them.  Not sure if that applies to Forecast.io or not but worth mentioning.
I would denormalise all the lat/lon/etc data and just store data in 1 table/collection in a NoSQL/document db. This will still give you decent performance when you need to crunch the daily predictions.
Break data in parts, store in different columns. That's the purpose of a relational database.
I actually took a quick look at the MySQL documentation before making this post, and there seems to be two types for that:

1. In MariaDB, the Connect table type will allow you to map your table to a JSON file. It will figure out the structure and present it in a queryable fashion.
2. In MySQL (and Maria as well), there are JSON datatype where it seems like they're storing in a blob, with some special functions to query it. 

I'm really not sure of the performance implications for it, or how it will handle nested structure (e.g.: daily -> data collection -> entry -> field).

How do you cache in Redis? A single named (based on location-timestamp or something along those line) key, that gets pushed out over time? I was thinking I could do that with MemCache (yes, I'm a dinosaur), but now that you mentioned Redis, it definitely seem like a better solution as it is generally better than MemCache in every single way.
From my experience, this is generally not the case with weather APIs because they're also aggregating their data from government ran doppler that are generally public domain. I've double checked their TOS just to be on the safe side, and it looks like we are safe! https://developer.forecast.io/terms_of_use.txt

Thanks for the heads up! I wouldn't have thought to double checked if you didn't mention it :)
It already comes in denormalized via the API... unless you mean to de-noramlize it even further to be completely flatten for even the data collection? It definitely makes capturing and redisplaying the data super simple (e.g.: data in, data out, no thoughts involved). However, later queries, for example as noted in the original post, such as "Get me last 7 forecast for today from the last 7 days" where you're looking at different fields in each document, would be much more difficult than in a normalized database (`SELECT * FROM daily_forecast WHERE DATE(forecast_date) = CURDATE() AND lon...AND lat... ORDER BY 1 LIMIT 7`). My understandings there are limited, but wouldn't I need to grab all 7 documents from the NoSQL, and then look at individual indices (e.g. `for each(document in documents) { //get date 7 from document 0, get date 6 from document 1, ... }`)?  Or is there an easier way to grab that out by delegating that responsibility to the NoSQL DBMS?
Yes, that is the purpose of RDBMS... The question was more on whether or not there is a better way to capture that information in a query-able fashion, though. Not what is the purpose of a RDBMS.
We actually use both Redis and Memcached, so you're not a dinosaur! Memcached is a solid and consistent performer, which is always welcome in my toolkit. It's been a while since that code was implemented, but I believe we have a basic key like BlahBlahForecast:LAT,LONG and then the JSON string of the response.

In my case we don't store the entire response, since it was unnecessary, so we're actually storing a parsed version. On a lookup request, the cache is checked first, falling back to the API on 2 conditions - the information was never cached, or the cached data has expired. These conditions both appear the same way to the calling code, but I note it since having an expiration can be nice for something that changes as frequently as weather data.

If you're doing more historical database building, then a true persistent database seems like a better fit, for the the storage and the querying needs.
No worries; I assumed it didn't but it was more like a word of caution.  

I know I've come across that in the past with some major API's that make a bulk of their money on high volume (ESPN & Google Maps) users
Yeah I would just flatten it completely. Your data crunching becomes a bit more complex ([rough example](http://pastebin.com/Y5QJpuHy)), but your db queries will stay simple for any calculations you might want to try in the future. However, if you know that you are only ever planning on doing calculations by days, an ORM (ie. don't store in JSON) with a SQL db may serve you better. Sorry if I'm not articulating well, it's late here.
I think you've posted the contact.php script twice, if you update it to the contact.html page I can take a look. 
There are a few key issues I want to point out:

1) Your form submits to index.php, however you have posted source for contact.php and contact.html. Assuming that this isn't a typo created when posting here to reddit, I am not even sure how you are getting any notification of the email being sent at all.

2) Gmail is likely discarding the message as spam. You may be able to find the message in your spam box, depending on how the email is actually being sent and how the DNS records for that domain are configured. If you can find the message in your spam box, the raw source should show any DKIM/SPF failures. Gmail may also show a notice about why the message was marked as spam. You may need to reconfigure how the email is being sent (ex: via smtp) or contact your host for more help.

3) This form is subject to severe abuse. It would be worse if the address the message was being delivered to could be set to anyone. But even still, you will likely get a lot of junk or spam messages with this, and it is possible for malicious code to be emailed to you, which may be executed by your email browser. (This would be very bad for future deliverability)

4) Your code leaves me to believe you are very new to doing this. While I don't want to discourage you from learning to code, I do want to point out that the internet is generally a nasty place and many novice coders see their scripts abused to do all kinds of things they never even considered. Learning on a production website with a world-accessible PHP script is a recipe for problems. Make sure you have solid backups and that nothing important is being stored in this hosting account.

5) There are plenty of contact form plugins for scripts like WordPress, Drupal, Joomla, XenForo, and so on. There are stand alone contact forms out there for free and for sale. It may be better to use an existing but well coded script for production use... It will be faster to get moving, and less prone to problems.

6) Strongly consider using CloudFlare or a similar service to help protect your website. Even their free plan has a lot of useful features, is very helpful, and can offer some protection.


(Sorry to be a downer. I spent a while working in the abuse department for a web hosting company and have seen where stories and scripts like this lead far too many times... and it was never due to poor intentions on anyones part. The internet is a hostile place and sites get hacked all the time.)
I read that you should include a separate .php as a fall back encase the PHP in the html file doesn't run. If that is not the best practice please feel free to educate me. The contact.php is the same that comes before the DOM. I hope I am explaining it right. Thanks for the input.

You're not being a downer at all you're being real and I really appreciate that. I will look into CloudFlare. I am new to PHP. This is how I learn. Could you recommenced any specific stand alone contact forms? Thank you again for taking the time to post this. 
I wish I could, but I'm not very active with PHP anymore. I'd suggest a google search, searching github, or you can consider a site like CodeCanyon (paid, I'm not affiliated, but I've used their sister site for themes before) http://codecanyon.net/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&term=&view=list&sort=&date=&category=php-scripts%2Fforms&tags[]=contact+form&price_min=&price_max=&sales=&rating_min=
Just went to CodeCanyon and picked up. http://codecanyon.net/item/just-forms-full/11301529 I am working on implementing it now.  Thanks again. 
Awesome. My only other advice, for this and any other script, is that you keep it up to date. Any time the author releases updates (especially security updates) installing them right away will help to keep you more secure. That with regular backups should keep you pretty safe.
Thanks! Great advice no matter what software we're talking about.
Not sure what you mean by "hybrid", browser detection maybe?

If so, all you need to do (on desktop) is resize your browser window. If it changes to fit the width, it's responsive.
So there are 2 types of Web design: [responsive](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/Responsive_design) and [separate desktop & mobile sites](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/Mobile/Separate_sites).   Then, there's the [hybrid](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/Mobile/A_hybrid_approach) that combines the two.  

It's easy to distinguish a responsive website by resizing the browser.  A website that uses "separate desktop/mobile approach" is similar to facebook that redirects the user to "m.facebook.com".  

Now what confuses me is identifying a hybrid webstie.
If I'm not mistaken you are talking about a site like Stack Overflow, right? It uses the same URL for desktop & mobile but on mobile the site is completely different, and the desktop is not responsive. So you can still do the whole "resizing the browser" for that.

Edit: by the way you can load a mobile site on desktop using Chrome Dev Tools (Ctrl+Shift+I). Click the mobile icon, it will resize the page. If it fits in the window at this point it's responsive. Then reload the page and it will spoof a mobile browser so the server will send you the mobile version. If anything is different to the "resized window" version, they are using some adaptive techniques.
Given your definition it seems like you'd want to automate testing from a few client types and resolutions, maybe 2 desktop sizes and 2 phone/tablet sizes. Then you need to process the response - meta tags, the URL subdomain, size, etc could all be signals into your classifier.
This method is very new to me. I have no idea Stack Overflow is doing this and I find this quite good to separate the desktop view and mobile view but with the same domain!
I really like the dark color scheme. Does anyone know which one it is (if it's not a custom one, of course)

top bar is too big
Try toggling hardware acceleration on the overlay using backface-visibility: hidden or will-change. This will toggle the hardware compositing mode in Chrome and a create a new composite layer.
cursor:none is freaking me out..
Yeah, please never do this though, unless it *really* seems necessary. 'Fun' custom mouse pointers are almost always just irritating.
Very rarely is this needed..
I don't. Unless I'm making tons of tiny sites, I don't see the need to bother with what I'm just going to tear down anyway.
I make quite a few small sites and I would love to use it if I felt more confident in being able to quickly make my own generator.. right now it feels like it would take a lot of fiddling and I barely got my gulpfile to work just right so yeah..
I don't think Yeoman really saves you that much time. It seems like one of those things built for showing how fast you can make a simple todo app at conferences. I guess if you're cranking out a site or two a week it might be worth it.
I find that I prefer to set up things on my own for small sites be cause then I won't have to tear out all of the features I don't need. For me removing features is less fun and more time consuming that grabbing what I need. It also encourages me to use fewer libraries. 
I used to, but now I have my own minimal template, just enough to get started. I found it easier to add as needed instead of removing.
Yes but I only use it as proof of concept for my backend code. If people want lots of custom work in the frontend I just tell them to get a frontend developer to do the real work.

It mean I find a "seed" and use it as is. I do almost no modifications to the core and just add my pages in the way the maker of the seed suggests. 

I use it like Ikea, that is the picture on the box, that is what it has to look like. Rather then Lego where you mix and match and create your own design. 

Sometimes I have to change seeds for a new project because the creator stopped maintaining it and then I find a new one. If one doesn't work,  I try another.

I am really really lazy when it comes to this. I primarly use PHP and the stability and usability of composer has completely ruined me for the javascript environment, bower, grunt, gulp, npm, node/nodejs naming, install this as root, install this as user. FUCK IT!
I do a lot of Wordpress work and it Yeoman saves me a ton of time on spinning up a wordpress instance in a Vagrant box. 

I used it. Didn't found a nice generator fitting my needs (at that time) and wrote my own boilerplate:

No Need for yeoman..

http://github.com/kreativgebiet/kickup

Featuring:
- Gulp.js
- ES6 (Babel)
- Scss
- file-include (HTML partials)
Yeah I agree with this.

I usually use it when i'm just mocking something up real quick. For example we had a client who wanted some weird tab slider control on a slideshow on their site. I used yeoman just to scaffold a quick page to try some things out. 
That's really cool. I am going to have to look into something like that. Nice!
What?
Don't you understand something?
I think there's a site or two out there that supposedly does this, but you'll be competing with other developers on what I imagine is mostly cost and a little bit of experience. You *might* be better off finding a handful of clients with ongoing needs via word of mouth.
My two agency clients have found me via LinkedIn and my portfolio site. I have rarely seen postings for agencies on sites like Elance/Upwork but none of them sounded like something I wanted to pursue.
Better yet, stop putting copyright dates on the bottom of pages. It isn't necessary, and if you haven't updated the contents of your page this week then 2015 really is the copyright date.
I love how Javascript needs `getFullYear()` not `getYear()` because of Y2K.
Actually, an old copyright is MORE valuable.  If I can prove you've been violating a copyright for five years, you'll be penalized more than if you violated it just recently.

But there's no magic that happens when you put a copyright symbol on your text.  That's the default behavior anyhow.
Or just remove the notice all together because copyright is implied and protected already. 
Putting a date on the copyright on a webpage doesn't really do much for you legally anyway. It does at least let people know it's under copyright so maybe that would discourage some people from copying it.

I think putting the date is mostly a way to make it look like the website was at least maintained in the past year (even if it may actually be an automatic date).
I suspect that having client-side copyright dates is a good way to have your copyright claim invalidated in courts. The client just needs to set their computer's dates to an older date and then they get an older copyright.

That being said, you should really just remove the copyright mark altogether. I am not a lawyer, but I have heard that those copyright marks on webpages are useless anyway as they are all implied as copyright by the page owner, like all creative works. That's why, for instance, you don't see copyright marks on paintings. (Would appreciate a clarification from someone more versed in this law though.)
They went to so much effort and only included examples in two langauges? Sheesh.
Should have made it johnoliver.com
> Using Javascript to insert copyright dates.

The bots scraping your site won't be able to tell when it was copyrighted!
Joke's on you. Back in November I actually remember I had to that, so I changed the footers of all the websites I maintain... to 2017.

Hey, if Car manufactures can do it, why can't I?
Thank you. It said 2014.
`document.write`, really?!?
There is a website dedicated to this ?
A far better alternative is a SQL-driven approach.  When updates are made to the site, you can reflect that in the data in the footer automatically without any extra effort.
Panicked for a second... then looked and saw it already calculates the year. Yay for Jekyll. 
thanks for reminding..
Don't want to be smug, but my site is built with a Grunt task and uses Moment.js to set the year when generating the HTML, so for me this is as easy as running `grunt deploy`.
Ahemm.. Reddit's footer
    <?php echo date("Y"); ?>
Or don't hardcode the current year and have it automated.
I always wondered what is the purpose of this copyright notice, can you explain?
I agree. This reminds me of websites that use today's date in all their articles, it's useless and misleading.
Or use <?= date('Y') ?> or the equivalent in your language of choice so you never have to think about it again.
I don't think ahead, but I twigged this a couple of years ago.
And you are only able to feel this way because your consciousness was chosen to be put into the big simulation after the world ended in the year 2000. 
Except a copyright should be updated on any notable content changes to indicate that the copyrighted work has changed. In your scenario, if you wish to keep the oldest date, then you'll wind up with a comma separated list of years, similar to a book that's been updated with new editions over time. 

Similarly, if you go to Amazon and look up the newest edition of a book, the copyright date will be the latest one not the oldest one. If you REALLY want to be legally protected, you'll keep a log of publish dates and content associated for your own purposes. At a job a few years ago we actually had this issue come up and we had to go through server logs to determine when some content first showed on our website to close a copyright claim. 
Not necessary but if you do use a copyright symbol, you should include the year it was published.

http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/when-do-you-need-copyright-notice-websites-and-where-do-you-place-it.html
Leaving a second comment because the ludicrousness of the claim being invalidated because the code is client side versus server side needs addressing. In both scenarios, the final rendered code is HTML, which can be edited client side and lend itself to the same issue you mentioned. The claim that doing it server side might somehow protect you is kind of asinine. Additionally, I wouldn't expect a judge to recognize, or care about, whether the HTML was generated client side or server side. 
> I suspect that having client-side copyright dates is a good way to have your copyright claim invalidated in courts. The client just needs to set their computer's dates to an older date and then they get an older copyright.

It wouldn't invalidate, because the copyright doesn't depend on whether the copyright notice is accurate. As you said, the copyright notice is doing nothing basically.

But yes, having an automatically-updated copyright year is very misleading. The copyright year is supposed to be the year the work was created (or, if you added new stuff that is by itself copyrightable, the year you added the last stuff). It doesn't mean "current year" except if the work was created this year.
> I suspect that having client-side copyright dates is a good way to have your copyright claim invalidated in courts. The client just needs to set their computer's dates to an older date and then they get an older copyright.

and I thought I was just being paranoid when I decided to generate this backend! kidding, kidding..

For srs though it's mostly because it's expected. I'm not even gonna bother with the headache of trying to convince people they don't need it heh. For my own stuff, it will be nice.
I use PHP so it gets the time from the server. I try to use JavaScript as little as possible. I think the amount of JavaScript used on some sites is obnoxious. I'll be glad if it ever gets deprecated. Flash is gone and JavaScript is next on my list.
Actually they will. Googlebots run js-scripts and cache the result as well
`document.write` is probably the best option here.  Inserting via DOM manipulation would require waiting for the document to be ready, and a more complex script.  `document.write` goes in the same place that the text would go (making the raw HTML easy to read) and takes a negligible amount of time to run.  If `document.write` is the biggest issue with your site, I would love to buy you a drink and ask you how it's done...
Yeah, needs more jQuery...
It's like a 5 minute job and like $5 for a DNS entry. Not exactly tough to 'dedicate' a folder on webhost to something like this.

There's a lot of reasons, as u/60days mentioned, and there's also other stuff like trademarks and attributing copyright to other entities like that which businesses like to protect and cya themselves for in case of a lawsuit.

There's cases like NYT vs Tasini in 2001 in which is deemed reuse of copyrighted materials by freelance newspapers and magazines in commercial electronic databases without permission was infringement so by putting notices on the website, its sort of like a warning. Or according to my copyright book, a "stop and go light". 

I think reading the [DMCA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Millennium_Copyright_Act) would probably be the best response though on how it plays in terms of legal in the US.


I found a site with sneaky news article pages that would output the month and day when it was posted, but always in the current year. If the date would result in a future date, it would simply subtract one year. I didn't see it until I found an article posted on Feb 29, 2015.
Eh, nobody does that, right?
Your #1 source for current, up-to-the-minute news!
Never seen that before
Well there are some good reasons to include the post date of an article.

Thanks! I'd be willing to bet that if it ever came to court, the mark could be ruled invalid as it wasn't actually representing the date published but rather the 'current' year as imprinted by the viewer's computer, which can be arbitrarily set.
the judge shouldn't really care if the message is there at all, copyright is implied and automatic.
Do you have a decent, widely supported, full featured alternative? 
But JavaScript is faster and removes a burden from your server, so it's fantastic for things that aren't necessary important like form input validation. 
I was referring to perhaps less copyright averse bots. :P
*Some* of Google's bots run js, there are plenty of more bots out there except for Google's, and there are several reasons for users to disable javascript.
> Inserting via DOM manipulation would require waiting for the document to be ready

Entire DOM doesn't have to be ready. Script can be placed immediately after the container.

> a more complex script

Yes, much more complicated.

Ditto.

> If document.write is the biggest issue with your site

It *was* a big issue in a project I was working on. It prevented us from asynchronously loading any chunk of HTML that uses document.write. We had tons of widgets that relied on it, and they all broke when we tried creating fancyboxes/greyboxes/lightboxes/ajax-modal-dialogs with them.

Yeah but he's right though. There is literally nothing else on the site. 
And a lot of them. While it's actually a pretty good link.
Better link submission titles help as well. The way it's worded says "here's a reminder that you should go update them manually"
Instead of hardcoding '2015' you would just use {{date}} which you get from the server.  Exact implementation depends on the language.
I was actually thinking about Django just a few hours ago, I haven't really touched it since 2010 or something... Was wondering if anyone still uses it.
(CC Technical Lead here) There's a bunch of different CC licenses, so its useful to specify which one you're using. 

A useful thing about a copyright statement is that you can identify who to contact. Just because an article is published on a particular site, the copyright may belong to someone else.
[This article](https://www.plagiarismtoday.com/2012/06/27/why-bother-with-a-copyright-notice/) notes that three key benefits are:

1. Though most countries donâ€™t require a notice, having a notice may provide some protection in those that do.
2. It prevents confusion on the nature of the work and keeps others from thinking it is not copyrighted.
3. It eliminates innocent infringer claims, maximizing the amount of damages that you can win should you decide to sue.
Hmm, maybe most of this websites don't do that anymore because they realized how bad it is or maybe now they just avoid displaying any date at all... or maybe they disappeared. I used to run into sites like that, from time to time, a few years ago. I guess they were probably made by people who thought displaying the current date/time made their sites more "dynamic" and useful for their users.
/u/Worworen said that they include today's date in the article, not the post date of the article.
I didn't know that I am that stupid. 
Damn I am smart.
Everyone on Reddit is a bot except you.
And with Math.random's low entropy, we should eventually see all events in history repeat themselves.
Well, as noted on that link, the date should be updated whenever a notable content change is made.
Well yea, that's the point I made in the first comment but had to come back to make a second comment because it was just too over the top. 
So if I use Lynx or have JavaScript disabled, is your work in the public domain now?
Client side validation should always be in addition to server side validation and is only for making the user experience better.

While that's true, it also makes sense to _actually read the article before commenting on it_.

Which is what the website behind the link says. So... also to you: Read the link before commenting.

The link promotes automating it. So /u/tw2113's comment doesn't make any sense and he clearly didn't read the content of the page.

I think he was indicating that there shouldn't be a round trip for an initial validation, not that this should only fall on the client side to handle.

mail() assumes there is a mail command on the running server, and that its setup a certain way. You'll have a much better tie setting up SMTP mail and avoiding all the unknown variables that no one here can test for you.
It works for me. Do you get an error, or do you just not receive the email?
Are you seeing the success message after submission? Have you checked your error log?
Textarea nuance maybe?  Try this instead:

    $comment = htmlspecialchars($_POST['comment']);

Try using Phpmailer: https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/blob/master/examples/mail.phps
It makes proper header for you. If you testing it on a shared hosting the From: might need to be the same as the domain from which you are sending, security on hosting provider to avoid SPAM sending.
You could also send via SMTP:
https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/blob/master/examples/smtp.phps   (change SMTPDebug to 0 when it works)
You might send it via your Gmail:
https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/blob/master/examples/gmail.phps
I do not get the emails
Have you check your spam folder?
yes
Not sure what to tell you. I copied/pasted your script to my server and [it works fine](http://i.imgur.com/v1eliTk.png). I'd try /u/smallcomment's suggestion.
What is the domain name of the e-mail you are testing? Are you by chance using a gmail address? If so, if I remember right, gmail just auto kills any email with a "from" address of gmail.com if it doesn't come from their servers (or any domain that has a SPF record and it doesn't match)

So you wouldn't even see it in spam.   Try changing the "from" address to something the server is authorized to send.
Whatever it is, it doesn't work.

There is a tremendous amount of free information on the Internet. You don't really need books anymore.  I would recommend doing a Google search for things you want to learn. Stack Exchange and w3schools are great resources for information and troubleshooting. Chances are someone has run into the same issue as you have.  

Eventually you'll want to move beyond html and CSS and want to learn some back end. Choosing a "stack" is a bit important. I personally develop on Microsoft technologies, C#, SQL, ASP/MVC. If you're on a Mac you might check out MySQL and PHP.

If your goal is to build a site for your business, decide what features you want and begin to research how to create those items. I've found that having a project or goal in mind always helps me learn a new concept.

Best of luck to you!
Thank you for the reply and good luck gesture ! 

I appreciate what you're saying, but the book I have bought is actually very useful to me. It's so easy to just read through a chapter and use what i've learned on my website. But granted, it may not be worth buying new books, on top of what I own.

I will look into your suggestions - they are hugely appreciated, thank you ! And all the best to you too :)

Happy new year ! 
I totally get the book thing. That's how I taught myself 20 years ago. In that case I would recommend a "Teach Yourself ______ in 24 hours/7 days" etc.  This will guide you through an entire project and introduce new concepts that build on each other.

Microsoft provides several free courses at Microsoft Virtual Academy. Another great training site is Pluralsight. I'm a seasoned developer and I still get a lot out of their courses.
Pluralsight is a one I am also using, but more sporadically for something i'm interested in. Maybe I should use it more to focus on what I really need to learn. 

Thanks again for the advice ! I may look into your suggestions if I don't get what I need out of the one I have.
Thanks again ! 
http://scrapy.org/ ?
Python would probably be better, but I think you should make it slightly more complicated in favor of speed.  Have 3 parts:  
1) The scraper.  Goes through all the sites  
2) Messaging queue/task queue.  Once a page is viewed by the scraper, it's saved and then the messaging queue is sent a "Process this page" task which is completed by a seperate thread  
3) The parser.  Gets the next available task and processes it.

I've tried using PHP for the same thing and at the time it was really slow (~5.4).  Do Python or even Golang which is compiled and very easy to learn.
Python all day. There's a wealth of awesome language related python libraries that will make your life a million times easier. Also, it's threaded so you can have many instances at once all working in parallel. 
If you want to build desktop application then we recommend Python because it's general purpose language. The Google web crawler is written in Python.

Do you ever see any desktop application written in PHP or do you find a job in PHP to write the desktop applications? The Answer is NO.
Awesome read. Thanks for sharing!

Why not just use a private key? It won't be inadvertently given to someone else (you might send your 'password photos' to your friend by accident), and is much smaller in filesize.

The photo authentication thing sounds like a cool idea but I don't think it's very practical.
Cool idea, but IMO it's a solution to a problem that doesn't exist. Stop remembering passwords and use a password manager.
I would not upload my images. I don't know where they're stored, who sees them, etc.


Also, as an iPhone user, my camera roll is in reverse chronological order. That means that as I take more and more photos over the lifespan of my phone, the authentication photos get buried. Not worth the hassle. 
Interesting idea, but I just don't see a practical scenario for it. 
I would have to have the pictures on every device I want to sign in on. Yes, pictures are easier to remember but what if I have a picture that looks pretty close to the one I used for my password? Now I can't remember which one to use. Honestly, if I forgot my password I think I could reset it in roughly the same amount of time I would spend digging through pictures every time I want to log in. And if you store the pictures in some special favorites folder, then there goes any security, might as well just store a txt file with the actual password. At least then I only need to copy and paste one string as opposed to finding two pictures.
1. I want to log in using a desktop machine
2. I want to log in using someone else's phone/machine
3. My kid just deleted the photo.
Questions?

1. How will this work on desktop or tablet?  I assume now the user has to put those photos on there other devices?  Or is this mobile only?

2. How are the images stored?  Why would or should people give you access to their camera roll?  Privacy is a big thing.

3. Like some have said before, scrolling through your images is a hassle.  Also what if you need to log in on different phone/device aka someone else's phone?

Sounds like a cool idea but not a good real world feature. 
This is really neat! I've been thinking about how passwords are terrible, so I like this idea. Another option could be to upload the photo, then draw a gesture on it, kind of like the Windows photo gesture lock screen, but you supply the picture. The problem I see is that there are only a finite number of photo combinations, so if someone steals your phone and has free time, they can try everything. A photo + gesture (drawing on top of the picture) would be more secure. 
Not everybody uses an iphone and often people lost their images for various reasons
You should check out [SQRL](https://www.grc.com/sqrl/sqrl.htm).
Blind people couldn't login. Also, how do you prevent shoulder surfing to see what photos a user selects?
Is the goal just not to remember long passwords, or does it provide some additional security as well? And why not use a single image?
Requires photos?
I don't think that anyone has commented on the challenges users might face when intentionally distributing the photos to their other devices. For example, a user might not notice that their photos are being altered when they upload them to Google Photos, or that they are compressed when they text them to their new phone. There are many ways that photos change without the average user knowing that it will affect the hash. 
Haha fun idea. Doubt that it will be very practical. 
So I just uploaded 2 example images and I seem to be authenticated. Whoever it is, it's not me!
Mind sharing the hashing algorithm you used?  I'm curious how it can detect and ignore minor changes to the image that might occur when copying, emailing, etc etc.
This is really interesting idea. I'll have to see what I can do.
what you sell as a feature (the private key will work with error correction e.g. compressed images) will be the future exploit. please learn crypto first, then give it another try.
It's an interesting idea, but I'd still prefer at least the option to have a complex passphrase, more traditional 2fa, etc., which I can make as secure as I like. I agree that user authentication is a UX issue and often poorly done, but I don't think this is the solution.

I take a lot of pictures and don't keep them on my devices because there are so many; having 2 miscellaneous older photos and either a batch of new ones (pre-transfer) or a conspicuous absence of other photos may as well be pointing to which ones are used for authentication. With cloud backup and apps that are a little too permission-heavy (seriously, SO many request camera/gallery access), I wouldn't think my photos were sufficiently protected for anything I'd want to keep truly secure. I also don't care for the overhead of having to send those photos to any/all places I might log in. If I borrow a friend's device, it would be a weird step and their own backup settings might save my auth photos as well.
It's a great idea but I'm not sure how practical it would be. Maybe as cloud photo storing services (Google Photos, for example) are growing, it could work, but if someone used photos from their computer to sign up, and they didn't have the same on their phone, or what if they got deleted (intentionally or accidentally)...oh dear. Also, it's hard work going through all my folders and selecting the photos, and in a real world situation I personally would much rather just use a normal password.

Plus, how would a "Forgot my photos" thing work?
Have you guys heard of https://getclef.com/ ? Cool little thing I've been using with many of my projects. 

Clef is secure two-factor auth with no passwords or tokens.
I log on to my services using a mobile phone, a work computer, a personal desktop, a personal laptop and sometime my friends' computers. In the last few years I've reformatted each of those at least once, sometimes more (except my friends' computers) I'd be mad if I had to find these two particular photos each time I need to authenticate, even if I only used one device.
Why *two* photos?
This is a really bad idea by itself. This has the possibility of only providing a single bit of entropy. Along with a strong password, this would be a good idea. To replace a password, though... No. Just because it's easy doesn't mean it's good.
I am curious to people's thoughts on whether, if using a desktop browser, it should request the two images using two separate dialog boxes (instead of requiring you to hold down ctrl or shift or whatever to allow multiple images to be selected. 
I think this is a great fucking idea! 
Traditional private keys aren't sufficiently user friendly for most people. This is essentially a private key in most ways that matter. The filesize isn't relevant - the image isn't sent anywhere. 
If you accidentally send a photo to a friend it's not necessarily a problem. The friend would need both photos, know which two photos to use together, and know the site to use them on. 
I use 1Password, but it's an acknowledgment that secure passwords are too hard and easy passwords are useless. The real answer lies in multiple authentication factors, where all of the difficulty is not in remembering or providing those factors but in obtaining them in the first place. They should be inherent to the owner, and difficult for everyone else. I guess that's my real issue with this particular method, that pictures aren't hard for others to obtain, and any social friction around sharing particular images will be suspicious and probably exploitable. 
Password managers aren't always an option (eg. work or school computer). Many don't work in incognito mode. Many have poor plausible deniability. Many have security flaws. 

edit:typos
The photos aren't uploaded. They're processed client side. 
Your iPhone has albums and favourites though. 

The images aren't stored at all and they need not contain any identifying information. Just take a photo of your lunch one day.
It's not your wife's naked pics...
It sounds obvious, but hopefully you choose photos that are sufficiently distinctive that you'll remember which one you chose. 

I definitely feel as though a 'favourites photos' folder is less conspicuous and risky than a 'passwords.txt' file but to each their own. 

Keep in mind this is designed for a very specific scenario - mobile users in private browsing mode.
1: have the photos on your desktop machine
2: no way around this unless you carry a usb stick or other media with the photos. Same for a private encryption key btw.
3: nobody said that it is impossible to have a "i lost my photo(s)" function, lots of private key encrypted services has one.


1. It's designed for mobile but works anywhere as long as you have the photos accessible. There's nothing fancy going on - just choose the two images from your Dropbox or whatever using the file dialog. 

2. They're not stored at all. They're not even sent anywhere where they could be stored. The webpage doesn't get access to the camera roll. The two images you choose, and only those two, become temporarily loaded in the browser, then they're hashed, then they're discarded. 

3. Use albums or favourites to deal with the camera roll problem. If you need to login from another device you need to get your photos onto that device. 

It's not a technology for every situation. It's also not necessarily a technology that you wouldn't pair with something else. Hopefully it's interesting and useful somewhere though. 
You can definitely pair this with lots of things including gestures, sms messages, and traditional passwords. Gestures are really identical to traditional passwords except they're *differently* memorable and suited to certain input devices (keyboard vs touchscreen). Sadly most people choose from a very small set of memorable and easy to draw gestures.

If someone steals your phone and breaks the security on the phone you're in big trouble anyway (most apps on your device are pre-authenticated). When it comes to brute forcing (trying every image combination that you find) the attacker still needs to know which site to target and the vulnerable site needs to have no brute-force defences. If a site has no brute-force defences then passwords and gestures will be a bad idea too so you're no further behind.
There is no reason that web developers couldn't provide a password reset feature for users who somehow lost an important photograph that they didn't have backed up.

This doesn't have any iphone specific about it. It should work in any browser on any platform as long as it can upload files.
Know it well. 

I actually built something almost identical in 2013 but that didn't rely on a third party qr scanner (used a pure js qr code reader and html5 camera access). Relevant link :)
Both great points. If someone shoulder surfs you and then steals your device and access your device you're screwed. Although then again, if they do that you're screwed no matter what.

To be honest the usage scenario I had in mind when I came up with this was quite specific - it was for sites that people typically use when they're alone.
Using two images just increases the security. With a single image a person who somehow got access to your photos could try a picture and potential have success. By requiring a pair they would need to find the exact two images you used on a particular site. 

It might provide additional security for a few reasons, one being because it potentially makes it easier to have a unique username per site. It's also a lot faster to choose the two images instead of typing long and unique strings into a login page, especially on mobile when in private mode. 
It requires a pair of images. I recommend using photos because they're more likely to be unique. It can be a photo of your shoe. It doesn't need to be anything interesting. 
The hashing is perceptual. Modest compression and re-sizing shouldn't alter the hash. I've tested it a few times but nothing exhaustive. If others find examples where the hashing algorithm needs to be tweaked that would be handy. It's a fixable problem if it emerges.
Hopefully it's practical in *some* situations. Are there any things that would rule it out from being *ever* practical from your perspective?
When you upload a pair of images it generates a pair of hashes from those images. A web developer can use these hashes to authenticate the user. You've just misunderstood what's happening :)
I'm using a very simple algorithm in this instance but in essence this is what's happening http://www.phash.org/
Feel free to message me here if you need it customised or if you find any problems. It's definitely just a preview at the moment.
The only cryptographic issue with perceptual hashing is the resulting key space. Save the passive aggressive tone. I'm pleased you raised this, I'm aware of it, it's definitely a consideration when it comes to tweaking the configuration of the hashing algorithm to balance resiliency of hash to image transformation and security.
I like clef too. I built something similar back in 2013. This has a different usecase.
Fewer photos increases the chance of hash collisions and the chance of someone getting lucky if they get access to you photo library. More photos makes it harder to remember. Two seemed like a reasonable balance to get started with. 

Someone here proposed one photo plus a gesture. I think that's a great idea too. 
How would it provide a single bit of entropy if used with photographs taken by the user?
Why not both? Allow a multiple select, but if the user only submits one image using that, re-prompt for  a second image.
Oh, I see. I've changed my mind - it does sound practical for most people.

It might be midly inconvenient to find the two photos every time the user wants to log in (especially if they don't put it under their 'favourites'), but I can't really see any other problems other than that!
Keep in mind, many other apps will have access to their photos. Since you are processing and hashing in JS it would be very easy to duplicate with access to user photos, and only need a few dozen brute force attempts.
The pictures are potentially exactly as difficult to obtain as a cryptographically generated private key. They're just less obviously valuable when stored on a device.

Keep in mind that this process can easily be used with other authentication methods. It's a 'something you have' (the photos) combined with a 'something you know' (which two photos to combine on a particular site).

Remember there are a lot of boring and crap, but still unique, photos on most people's smartphones.
So you tell me people have those 2 images with them when at work or at school? no, they don't.
Use keepass. You can put it on a phone, or carry a portable version on a USB key chain. It's not a browser extension so there's no problems with incognito. It's very secure, and open source. 
Your solution has flaws. Nothing is flawless. What's important is to understand the risk. Saving a picture password on my computer is as safe as saving my password in a txt file and hoping nobody finds it.
Images aren't always an option, for at least as many situations that pw managers aren't.

Also, what happens when you're going through your "old boring photos" and delete them?
I'm also surprised that people don't have any boring photos on their phone. I've got a tone of crap and it takes tenths of a second for me to add more :)
No it's yours
I'm not talking about a regular gesture though. For example, say I have a picture of a house. My gesture is  drawing the outline of the door. Or if it is a car, it's an X over the tire. 

Something like that is much easier to remember since the picture will remind you of the gesture, but not anyone else. 
the use of camera roll threw me I guess. 

This is a neat idea, but I personally would find it cumbersome. For example, I don't even have a working camera on my phone at the moment (and no images saved in gallery)

Personally I think it's too limiting. There's one thing literally every web capable device has and that's a keyboard.
Just say it, porn sites.
> By requiring a pair they would need to find the exact two images you used on a particular site.

Which isn't very hard unless you have tons of photos on your computer.

A simple password is way more secure than 2 out of 20 photos.

Also, if this gets used on multiple sites, do you really think a user can remember the two different photos they used for each one? Nope, they'll just start using the same images for both, which is waaaaaay less secure than a simple password.
> I've tested it a few times but nothing exhaustive. 

So you have no clue then? 

How can you even say it doesn't alter them when you haven't even tested it with the most common platforms where people would be sharing photos between devices?
Sure, no doubt! I just meant it won't really replace other forms of common login such at oauth or passwords. =) There are probably some practial use for it. At least its innovative!
Sure, no doubt! I just meant it won't really replace other forms of common login such at oauth or passwords. =) There are probably some practial use for it. At least its innovative!
No I didn't. I just uploaded a few example pictures and I guess that is what 99% of your users do. The images I used were windows example images. This is the new "password" / "123456"-password. This could be a proof that it's the wrong way / not the solution to the problem.
Realised the same thing after writing my comment :)
Agreed. It'll just be a balance of convenience from the photo selection vs remembering and entering a unique username and password combination on a mobile keyboard.

Thanks for the feedback btw. Hadn't thought of the private key analogy until responding to your original comment. I think it'll be a useful part of explaining this concept in the future.
A few dozen brute force attempts to do what though? The website can still use traditional methods for preventing brute force hacking. A few failed attempts (by providing the wrong pair of images) and the ip is temporarily banned or the account is temporarily locked.

You're right that a evil application developer could attempt to reverse engineer the hashing algorithm, then write a rogue application and coerce a target user to install that application on their device, then they could generate hashes for all of the images of the device, then they could attempt to login using all possible combinations of all images on the device, and maybe the website owner doesn't provide any protection from brute-forcing... but if the evil developer can coerce the user into installing a rogue application specifically designed to attack the user then the user is f*cked no matter what.

edit: spelling
Emailing yourself a few photos isn't typically a big deal.
It's not a user experience I particularly enjoy. Not saying there is anything wrong with it, just providing another option. 

One benefit of this approach is plausible deniability. If you use a password manager you can be forced to provide access to it and then everyone knows everything you access. 
That's not an option if your work or school keeps users from running executables 
Of course it's not flawless. Neither are password managers though. Of course everything is a complex balance between a set of risks and usability. Password managers have a place. I'm hoping that this might too.

It's typically a lot easier to find a password.txt file than it is to find a particular pair of needles in a haystack of needles. In any case this isn't designed to protect compromised machines from not disclosing sensitive information. A compromised computer will leak whatever it has. It's designed to provide something that has a balance of ease of use and security that might be useful to some dev out there.
I do have boring photos! We exist.
Excellent point.
This is about convenient security. If someone gets access to your computer or smartphone you're screwed no matter what. They'll immediately have access to your email and be able to reset your password on most sites. They'll also have access to all the password stored in your browser.

> they'll just start using the same images for both, which is waaaaaay less secure than a simple password.

It's exactly the same level of insecure except that the web developer in this case can't totally forget to hash the password (the hash is unique per domain - but dev's should still salt and hash the 'password' again before storing.).
Huh? I've tested it for a number of resolution and compression scenarios. It's a perceptual hash, if it looks the identical to a human it should generate the same hash. This is just a proof of concept, I'm sharing so that people can discuss, play, and test.
> I seem to be authenticated

That implied that you thought some kind of authentication was happening. Perhaps it's just me.

> I guess that is what 99% of your users do.

We'll have to just disagree on that point. I expect they'll use photos that they took, as requested of them. If two people both choose to use the same two very common images instead of one of the many unique images they have access to / create, and contrary to the advice I'd expect to see where this technology was used, then fair enough, yes, they're going to end up using the same account.

Blocking commonly used hashes is good idea though. I'll definitely make a note to do so if I ever evolve this into a service. Useful conversation! :)
No problem!
Sure, but you are still a 1 in x chance of succeeding. Someone would need over a hundred images for this to be as secure as a 2 character password which isn't that great. Temp lock is great and all, but how many temp locks before it's solved sounds like a real question especially with a small photo library.

edit: just saw your edit, and it sounds like you are trying to rationalize your way out of the issue. No need to convince me of your hopes, I'm just telling you why I would not use this past a low liability platform. A crappy password is probably still more secure if you are actually targeted.
> rouge application

Just so you know, this means "putting on makeup". You want the word "rogue".
So that's secure, emailing yourself your own password? Yeah, no...
How can you be forced to provide access to it?
Why are you looking at personal/secure things on public/work computers in the first place?
In your scenario, the password manager is a folder called Pictures and full of unencrypted files that could be passwords. That's called security through obscurity.
> if the evil developer can coerce the user into installing a rouge application specifically designed to attack the user then the user is f*cked no matter what.

I should have just left it at that... :)

The attacker does need to know which site to attack too remember. Appreciate the thought in any case.
Oops. Thanks. Got it right once and wrong once.
https://xkcd.com/538/

Excluding that, if I found a USB drive with a password manager on it I'd most likely spin up a few VMs and start the process of cracking the master key (assuming I can't get it through use of a keylogger). These are problems with all "single password" solutions. One leak and you're in big trouble. Zero day on your phone? Malware on a computer you plug your USB into? Everything burnt at once. 
How would logging into a site using keepass be browsing personal/secure things in the first place?
That's not what that phrase means. 

You know chrome has a password manager built in right? Would you consider it secure?
I just saw your edit, and it sounds like you are trying to rationalize your way out of the issue. No need to convince me of your hopes, I'm just telling you why I would not use this past a low liability platform. A crappy password is probably still more secure if you are actually targeted. Images are not private.
Your XKCD could apply to forcing them to provide which pictures they used to authenticate as well. Neither method is really for overcoming legal battles, it's just a secure way to manage credentials.

> Excluding that, if I found a USB drive with a password manager on it I'd most likely spin up a few VMs and start the process of cracking the master key

So you're going to crack an AES256 key on a couple of VM's? Okay.

EDIT: I keep my password file in a private cloud and then just keep the private key on my devices. That way password changes are automatically synced, automatically backed up, and the vault is useless without the private key. Someone would have to physically steal a device and then crack my very large passphrase. By the time that happens I'll have changed all of the passwords anyway.

Because you're trying to use your personal password manager while not on your own personal computer. If you're on a work machine then try to get management to let you install it for use with work. If you're on a school computer then... well.. use it for school.
Fair enough with regard to the brute attack. Combining this with a password would be one option. Deciding that you trust your image collection to be private is another.

I consider the images on my phone to be private. I suspect some other people do too. I appreciate this isn't the case in a pure sense but if apps on my phone decided to deliberately misuse my images I'd be in trouble regardless of how the websites I use authenticate users.

edit: typo
The xkcd thing is an exponentially larger problem when you use a master passphrase that tells someone the sites to target as well well as all of your credentials. You're right though. 

In the end I'm just offering another option here. The data indicates that there are still lots of problems with authentication for the typical user. I think this solution could work well for a specific combination of site and user. It's a quick way of combining a little "something you have" and "something you know".



What if you need to log into Dropbox or Google Drive for a presentation while at school or work but since the password is long and complicated and integrated into Keepass, you wont be able to get in without your Keepass meaning you're screwed.
> In the end I'm just offering another option here.

That's cool, and I'm not trying to discourage you from doing that. I just disagree with your points about password managers.

Your idea is neat but I would never trust it when security is needed.
Then you use a Google drive account provided by the school that has a shittier password. You can couple that with Google Authenticator to still be pretty secure.
The irony is that before developing this I developed a password manager. It's where my heart lies. My arguments against password managers came from that experience :)
React is gonna over take Angular? From the video I saw, angular 1 < angular 1 + react < angular 2. I'm confused
In my personal opinion:
angular 1&2 < react

Rather than trying to stream/proxy the video, just use the YouTube player APIs to seek to the right location with Javascript. You're going to need something (ie, a websocket server application) to maintain some sense of a group's state, but it's not a super complicated thing to do, versus dealing with streams themselves.

The basic workflow would look something like:

1. User A goes to your page with a YouTube player embedded on it.
2. User A clicks play, some JS you have on the client-side would detect the play event and start monitoring for progress events.
3. Your JS would send the position to the server, which would keep track that User A was at X seconds in the video.
4. Player B comes in, joins the session (which you're somehow managing in your back-end).
5. The server application tells User B's client-side JS which second User A last reported.
6. Player B's JS tells the YouTube player to seek to the location.

You can get more/less advanced with this. Websockets will give you the ability to be more dynamic (eg, if User A seeks and you want User B's video to also seek, this is really easy to do). If you go plain AJAX GET/POST, you're going to be dealing with higher latency and you probably have to throttle the reporting of User A's position. Either way there will be drift, so the clients may be slightly off from one another, but depending on how you fine tune your approach, you can mitigate this and make it reasonable. If you want to get fancy, you can force a sync or pause for catchup if things get really badly out of alignment.

For the record, I've done this before with non-YouTube players.
It depends on how exact you need to be.
Try it this way.

Set up a small server. User A goes to your site and plays the video. Every 3 seconds you send a small request to your server with the current timestamp and timecode of the video at where User A is currently.

When User B goes to your site, their browser fetches the timestamp/timecode pair from your server. They compensate for transit time by using the difference in fetched timestamp and User B current timestamp. Then applying that difference to the timecode of the video. Begin playing video at this point of the timecode.

If you wanted to track pause/stop events and wanted something quicker than the 3 second interval, you would need to use websockets instead of normal http requests.

edit: 3 seconds is a basic guess, you can choose a better interval based on server size and expected user count
I guess you will have to use flash to receive it and a server to broadcast it.
Thank you for the incredibly detailed response, these are some great ideas and it was exactly what I was looking for. I really appreciate your help!!
LOL, you posted this literally a minute before I posted basically the same thing.
This was very insightful, any suggestions on servers? I assume I should be looking at a company to do it for me since if the site suddenly grows, I would be stuck with my own small server without the ability to quickly expand
Would you mind going into a little more detail about how I can go about this, or citing a source that I can read up more about this? I'm very new to this field. 
A small node.js Digital ocean server should be able to expand for that fairly well. You did not give any numbers on what you are expecting for traffic and you also don't list what languages you are comfortable with.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Time_Messaging_Protocol  
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6486204/i-want-to-install-a-rtmp-server

https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/how-to-set-up-your-own-private-rtmp-server-using-nginx.50/
Well, to be honest, I'm outsourcing this project to a firm. Out of my own curiosity, I was curious as to how this would theoretically be completed. And since I would be responsible for expanding the server size as traffic increased, I was curious if you preferred a specific server.  
Thanks, I read up on the topic a bit and it makes a little more sense. So now that I understand how to stream via a webcam, how would I stream a video from YouTube then?
Firstly I doubt that this complies with YouTube's policies.

Secondly YouTube's videos are streams themselves and you want to stream it again. One simple solution would be to download the YouTube video and than simply stream it. Piping the stream would for sure be more complicated.

Another idea would be to simply embed the YouTube video and trying to sync it via JavaScript. Look at: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6671232/youtube-api-stop-video
You could do this with WebSockets.
There are a few (rather) large sites that already do the same concept. Dubtrack.fm/plug.dj (had to shut down because of funding)/turn.fm (still in development), how would they have gotten around this issue? After reading the policy, it looks like they just don't want you making money off of ad revenue on videos that aren't yours. So if ads aren't implemented on that specific page, then there shouldn't be any problems..right?
People are going to answer and say "of course, use Wordpress" or "use Jekyll", but if you have to ask, "hire a web developer".

That website platform isn't transferable so if you don't renew your GoDaddy website builder you'll have to start over from scratch on whatever platform you choose.

If we don't know the purpose of your site none of us can give you accurate advice.  If it's personal in nature, a free site builder may be suitable for you. If it's a business site, you should have some unbranded, hosted platform and preferably one that's SEO friendly. If it's e-commerce you'll need a platform with a shipping cart capability.

Can you give us any more information about the purpose of the site and your needs?
Squarespace, Weebly, Wordpress, Web.com, Wix. Most of these will also charge you. Squarespace will give you a free trial, Weebly has a free tier that brands the footer of the page, that's as much as I know. Generally if there is a free tier, it's also going to promote their site. I want to say that for Wordpress your domain would have to be something like yoursite.wordpress.com unless you're signed up and paying, but I could be wrong.

You'll really have to look into each of them yourself to figure out what suits your needs the best. Is it a business site? Portfolio? Blog? Are you selling from the site? Some providers may be better in different areas.

You can also hire a web developer if you need something special, but for a lot of websites these out of the box solutions will do you fine.
Hire a web developer.
Yes, GoDaddy's website builder is overpriced.  But their hosting costs aren't bad, in most cases.  Assuming your site is a small business site of sone sort, you can probably use use their ecomony/basic hosting.  It'll probably cost you about $12 per year for the hosting and about $10 per year for the domain.

You should be able to install WordPress. If you're not familiar with it, there is a learning curve.  WordPress is free, but you'll probably want to use templated.  Some are free, but many of the good ones cost money.

I used to use a desktop application - [Webpage Maker](http://www.webpage-maker.com) - to design my sites.  Some might say Webpage Maker is a oittle dated, but for basic sites, it's super easy.  There's a one-time cost of $50 for the software, but I like it because it's super-easy to use.
If your the owner of the domain name .. You could setup a server from home ... I've setup a LAMP server with a raspberry pi .... I got a static IP address from my ISP and I was on .... With little research you could probably find out how to do this yourself :) 
> (I do not know much about website hosting/managing at all, so simple terms please).

I think Squarespace is a good fit for you - hosting, admin, security is all taken care for you. Wordpress is my go-to CMS but if you're not a coder or do not have time for upkeep I hesitate to recommend it unless you're willing to pay someone to do it.
Thanks for the responses, but we are not at commerce site or a business. Simply producing articles we make ourselves about a passion (baseball). So although we would like to make some profit form ads and affiliate and such, there is no need to carry a big load. 

As far as losing everything, we are completely fine with re-doing the website (keeping article content, but doing everything in another platform). 

So I appreciate the hire a web developer comments, but we are not trying to do anything fancy at all. 
I see your argument. But i think many of us started like this.
So if you are willing to experiment: Do it! 
A developer is probably going to cost you more than $71. 
+1 SquareSpace for a simple blog and domain all in wonder.  If you're running a store, why not Shopify?
Hey, having made a few sites for promoting various games...

You'll probably want to list game features (eg. "four-way tilt control", "8-player story mode") that would be applicable for your game. Just short snippets that will get people interested to see more.

The awards would look nice as a sort of set of pins or badges somewhere that's not intrusive but visible enough.

As for the video, one approach that's a favorite of mine is the two-video preview approach: you have an HTML5 player autoplay a "preview version" of your video - make sure it is as small as you can make it (<2MB preferably) and *without audio*. Then, when clicked, it opens a lightbox or window with the full version from YouTube. This way the user must first interact with the video in some manner before you're making them download the real thing. Another good approach for this would be making a small GIF as the preview, but I always personally found GIFs to be difficult to compress gracefully and generally have better luck with small videos. One place you can see this done is on Blizzard's WoW Legion website (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/legion/), note how the site is also slightly different for mobile because it replaces some background elements in favor of static images to save bandwidth.

Actually if I had a design like yours, I might consider embedding the player directly into that phone image and give it a button or two somewhere on it that controlled the video. You know, so it was a sort of interactive player. Only if I could make it look OK on mobile though. Obviously since your game is a mobile game the importance for your site to look good on small screens is, as I'm sure you agree, rather high :)
Perfect response. The HTML 5 player is exactly what I was looking at as well so happy you also mentioned it. I'll be sure to make it full screen and low memory! The less clutter on screen the better, make it easier to make responsive as well so should be fine to optimize for mobile eventually. Thanks for the ideas though, appreciate it. I'll be sure to shoot a pm your way when its done ðŸ˜Š
You should have a look at [socket.io](http://socket.io/) :-)
Thought I'd tell you some info about my setup which might be useful to you in some way.

I've made/set up an ad hoc live cam with motion detection alerts using a rasberry pi and a USB wecbam.

I get the data from the webcam by using ffmpeg to take screenshots of what the web cam sees 30 times a second (overwriting the last screenshot).

Then in node I just watch the file for changes. For every change I send the screenshot to all connected socket clients (socket.io) and display it on a webpage.

In node I also run a small motion detection algorithm to compare the previous screenshot 10 frames ago to the current screenshot (so about 333ms) - if triggered it sends me text message (max 1 per hour) (using twilio).

ffmpeg is pretty great at detecting cams and there's a lot of help/guides so it's pretty easy to use. Only downside is that there is no sound - but that hasn't been a problem for me so far. I don't actually really need it for anything - only made it as an experiment.

The actual code you have to write is pretty small but you end up having to juggle/setup all the moving parts kind of manually. But it seems to work fine. CPU usage on the raspberry is low <10%.

2cents
I can't really think of anything, other than a simple PHP page with simple html consisting of iframes and Javascript that checks to see what choice you want (possibly through a separate page to select the options, and it'll write to a file on the Web server, which the Javascript checks for), without over complicating it

If you're worried about cpu usage and instant changes aren't too important to you, why not create an interval for when it checks for an update? 30 seconds to a minute couldn't possibly use any noticeable amount of cpu usage 
Websockets are great - if the OP is specifically interested in PHP and not node then there's http://socketo.me/ which is ratchet + PHP and websockets which is fairly easy to write and works really well.
Looks like a perfect solution, although it seems a bit complex to me at the moment.  It will probably take a while for me to learn and understand.

Thanks!
It depends how comfortable you are with code, but that's something that could be done with Twilio or Nextmo to send the sms, a tiny library in your favourite language in the backend to handle a route, and a bit of javascript on the front to send a post request.
Assuming you find someone who's not a complete clown, this could be done in a day or two using Twilio as already mentioned. I'd charge Â£500-Â£1000 depending on how much work you want done on the front end design. 

Should be plenty of people around here able to sort that out for you.

Why not meteor which you mention? 
Thanks! Looks really cool!
By the way the website is http://rsuikit.kodhus.com
I don't have a resumÃ© but if I were you, I'd write it up in markdown and style it with CSS. Easy and consistant.
I used markdown with an available PDF version for them to download from my site. 
If you write a resume, you've lost.
I just learned Markdown recently and it's perfect for resumÃ© writing, I agree. And if you use a Markdown editor like Mou, you can easily export your resumÃ© in HTML or as a PDF.
Why? 
If you use Markdown Preview Plus (chrome) and just `@import url("/mnt/storage/css/md.css");` from a static internal filesystem you can just print it as PDF. But it isn't as good.
Because you're looking to work for someone.
While I originally stumbled into this thread looking for examples that people have made with LaTeX, this kind of hit home for me because I want to work for myself and have a few clients on the side, but I need to buy a "new" car - so I'm making a resume to get a better position somewhere else.

But, I agree, the only way to "get rich" is to work for yourself.
Node JS is a great replacement for PHP, you could start with a course on teamtreehouse but it's paid, if not that then you could try learning NPM from online sites (extremely easy, a few commands on the terminal) and start Nodeschool. Good luck
Thank you !
Well, a *package manager* is not overkill... but you do install Bower with NPM. As far as I'm concerned, NPM is squeezing everyone else out, but it depends on your preferences and personal workflow. I suppose no one has quite won yet (even if NPM is winning).

Dependency management is important. Because projects are moving beyond single file jQuery plugins. Projects are becoming dependent on the work of other projects, or they have optional extensions, which you may or may not need.

So there's your project, which depends on other projects, which further depend on other projects. They all have updates, which may or may not be compatible with each other. Or, if an important bug was fixed in a minor version update, which will happen frequently if using an assortment of libraries, I don't want to fetch and unpack new zips every time that happens. The mere act of checking for updates becomes time consuming. There are pretty good odds if you manually fetch libraries, your code is outdated. With a package manager, just type `update` and get back to work.

Aside from bugs or enhancements, demands may change. You may not think you need an extension when you start, because you're trying to control bloat, but it turns out you do need that extra extension. Yes, you could go back to the site and build another download. Or if you're on a team, either send *everyone* back to the site, or retrieve a new zip and distribute it... that gets messy. Really messy.

Dependency management is also especially important for distribution. That thing you built for a client, could probably be used again, but it requires an assortment of files to work correctly. A package manger makes sure you have everything in place for your next project, or the next developer you need to get up to speed. 

But package managers are only a part of a complete breakfast. The simple "download a zip and include in the header" workflow, at least in my neck of the woods, has gone away, and that's being driven by package managers and their friends; more specifically, NPM, Babel and Webpack. 

If you need jQuery, you npm install it, then include it via Webpack config. jQuery doesn't even exist in the website files directory. It gets pulled into the transpiled file before launch. Libraries which support ES6 are included via import. In fact, nothing exists in the web application folder except "script.js," everything gets imported only as its needed. The same goes for CSS via SASS. NPM install Foundation, then import needed components as required.

>Dont you use cdn?

You seem to be using the term CDN to mean an external delivery. Yes, you should be using a CDN, but it should be *your* CDN. All of your assets should be on CDN, including CSS and images. In other words, cdn.mydomain.com. This way, you reduce DNS look ups and requests in general. You can deliver just about all the JS the site needs to run in one tightly gzipped file, and the CSS in *one* other tightly gzipped file.

> if you're on a team, either send everyone back to the site, or retrieve a new zip and distribute it

If you're on a team you wouldn't be sending back and forth a zip you'd be using git, svn, or some other version control system. 
Point 1 is valid, 2- if  i am using cdn that's still true, 3- i am lost, lets say i was not using cdn, i still would have file structure like this

./lib/jquery/...

./lib/bootstrap/...

./lib/fontawesome/...

dont people usually put all outside resources in one folder, say if it was nodejs that could be /public/lib/...
Right, so you distribute it by merging into your local repo, and pushing to the primary repo. Then everyone pulls into their local repos during their morning merge.

Now you're tracking external projects in your own repo. That's messy, at least in my opinion. At the very least, you're adding unnecessary overhead. I understand different strokes and what not, but I believe everyone's life is simpler if node modules -or external projects- go untracked, at least as much as possible.  A repo should be focused on in-house work; package managers are for taking care of the rest. 
Running the "bower update" command will update all the packages inside your bower_components directory. Easy as that. 
Is it that messy? Updating dependencies without testing them seems more messy to me 
Who said without testing? 
Hmm... I was thinking about something like this and what it could be used for, but this is quite different to how I'd do it.


Still pretty neat though, nice find
Advice: Add a static "About" page. I have absolutely no idea what this site is, its purpose, etc.
i like it, it's a good clean chat. Seems to be a few really minor issues but you're off to a good start. 
Congratulations - you invented IRC ;)
I like it! Nice and clean. How do you do the tap animations where when you tap it the circled fills the container? 
How long did it take to do the actual implementation of everything? Or were you kinda just building as you went? Very cool btw!
OP... 

This is amazing.  Don't ever stop. 
Looks like a really well done project. Im on mobile (windows Phone) and this may or may not be an issue you want to tackle but here goes:It's really slow for me. It made my browser freeze for some seconds and It took me more than 2 minutes to get in a chat room, and didn't get to chat.I understand there aren't many people in my situation.Also it said there was a problem with the certificate.Other than this looks awesome and looking forward to try it on my desktop
In terms of making it better, why does your stack use two different backend technologies? Removing the php would simplify your stack. You can authenticate through node/passport and do crud with sequelize or most nosql databases, you could then more easily apply the authentication to socket.io
Very cool, checkout [Jabbr](https://jabbr.net/) , a similar site but built with C#/SignalR (realtime library for .net similar to socketio)

https://github.com/JabbR/JabbR
Always had this kind of idea. I love your site! Keep it flourishing.
Hey you can't drop more than 1 box at a time. Interesting site but you'll have to moderate it or set up user moderation and administration cause people will come and troll the good topics and ruin it for people who want to talk about that #
What did you use for the I/O sockets? 

Edit: I'm also confused as to why you used PHP AND Node/Express? 
When are you adding the free pizza functionality?
... really? you could've just downloaded an irc client.
Seems quite obvious what the site is. 
Thanks!
I put radio on the internet!!!
Wooooo
I'm using Angular Material, buttons come like that by default. https://material.angularjs.org/latest/
There were 4 iterations of the site. The third iteration was good, but not good enough. So I started a new project from scratch 4-5 months ago and ported a good amount of code over from the third iteration. So the final version took about 4 to 5 months to finish.
Thanks! I'm more than happy you guys enjoy it.
I'm also on mobile, Android (Nexus 5). Everything ran pretty smooth for me, but Bernardes may have a point about certain mobile lag. See of you can get your hands on some other hardware to test speeds and things, failing that use emulators.
It started off with me using Laravel, and [Pusher websockets service](http://pusher.com), so the stack was just Laravel and Angular. Laravel is a great framework and I enjoy using. However, Pusher was too damn expensive and too restricting. So I scrapped Pusher and wrote my own Express/NodeJs websocket server (using [einaros/ws](https://github.com/websockets/ws), not socket.io). I thought about migrating it over to keep the full stack Javascript, but that would be unnecessary work. Also, I hate Javascript. It can go die in a ditch.

Edit: I actually feel I've mastered JavaScript at this point. I know it much better than PHP. But I still hate it, I don't know why.
Doesn't really make sense for OP's stack, but ty for the link, I was wondering if there was a .NET solution :)
Thanks! I still have a million things I want to do. I have big plans for this website.
There's already a number of mods :)
Already taken care of. When I first launched the site, there weren't moderators and we had problems with spammers. That problem was resolved.
I explained in [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/3z6cxn/two_years_ago_i_taught_myself_programming_in/cyk27zw?context=10000). And I'm using https://github.com/websockets/ws
i just quit my web development job, turns out there's already websites.
This was most likely a project just for learning experience. 
True - how would you learn coding? An original concept?         
I suppose coming up with an original idea, and designing the site structure, then the algorithms to run it is great - there's money to be made.          
But learning to code better and getting to know the stack you're using - isn't that setting the learning curve REALLY high? You wouldn't be able to google many of your problems for a truly unique site.
I like this more.. I can imagine certain communities having their spaces. Like halo online would be great if people used something like this.


irc is just a bit too much effort for most.
Key word being "purpose". 
I don't think it is. I mean I know it has chat rooms but what's the purpose?
I don't think it is. And I don't feel like digging around to confirm/refute the initial impression that it's an arbitrary chat room system or if it has a purpose/focus beyond that or if it has specific goals or communities it's trying to focus.
I love it - clean and functional. You're talented knowing you are self taught.

Please diversify your languages - PHP is unnecessarily dirtying your mind and soul. It's like the English language - full of ancient weird exceptions to spelling rules... like the spellings of Gnome, because, colour...  PHP has C constructs in it, mixed error handling models, mashed up API... 

Learn some C, C++, C#, J#, Haskell, COBAL, BASIC, Fortran, Ada, JSP...... 

You'll find some lovely code out there. PHP kinda prevents even great programmers from writing great code... you owe it to yourself to use quality languages with your skills!

What am I talking about - PHP is fine?

http://eev.ee/blog/2012/04/09/php-a-fractal-of-bad-design/
Did you put radio on the internet? No
Es6 might make you not hate it so much...
I'm biased, I'm a full-stack javascript dev. I started with php which i hate now :P lol, but seriously simplifying the stack will make it easier to maintain and deploy going forward.
I was just showing an alternative to compare . Maybe to get ideas on feature s. Also the jabbr folks are super cool and I'm sure would be happy to talk to op & share lessons learned (front end wise or general concepts , not stack specific)
Haha, best come back ive seen :D
Nonsense. 

I used to think that way before I actually started building things. Now I recognize that the language is possibly the least important part of building something of value.
Holy shit, judging by the downvotes, some people here really like php.
No, people just hate programmers pushing their opinions on others. There really is no rational argument against any programming language, any more than there is an argument against a spoken one.
A little bit of sick came up.
Not just any programmer! *Financial programmer* at the bleeding edge of coding!
Isn't it pretty irrational to simply claim that no rational arguments can be made on the subject? I'm pretty sure I can come up with some rational reasons not to use PHP, or any other language we could pick.
There is a difference between saying "x language is better at y than z" and "x language is a dirtying your mind and soul".
I feel i have a kinship with your username. Haha.
Sure, the difference is in one you're claiming an order among languages, and in the other you're giving a reason why a language is low in ordering.

You don't need to be a genius to say "oh language x has such and such problems? Let me Google search a language that doesn't have those problems."

As someone who has used PHP for a long time, it has serious problems.
It's right there in the link about *why* for PHP.
Any chance I can convince you to rethink using backbone? I know wordpress uses it, but it's a bit old now and there is allot of boilerplate code compared to more modern options. 
Would you mind sharing your thoughts a bit more? I've considered learning backbone myself, but also looked at other options. But i would like to hear what you think.

Very likely, in fact since posting this I've decided to go down the react route. Did quite a bit of reading over angular and react. Thanks for the tip though I feel more confident I've made the right decision now.
So I have Backbone stickers on my laptop I used to love it... I totally bought into the lean minimal aspect of it... but then I noticed I was just writing the same code over and over and over again. 

Once I started to use newer frameworks they just felt more "done" than backbone. And I know it gives you allot of control, but frameworks like react have put so much work into optimising DOM updates to make them as fast as possible and you miss all of that with backbone. With backbone you have to implement your own DOM rendering based on its event system. The code for this ends up being prone to memory leaks if you forget to unbind event listeners. 

Another thing I used to love about backbone was that it included underscore.js, which I used to use for just about every project. But Underscore.js has become largely irrelevant as most of its most useful methods have now been built into native javascript arrays (map, reduce, filter ect.) 

Backbone sort of laid the groundwork for modern front end frameworks but overall it has fallen behind. There are still allot of companies out there with code written in it they have to maintain so if you want to learn it to pad your resume by all means, but overall I'd go with something like React or Angular. Personally I have been using [vue.js](http://vuejs.org/guide/) latelly and I love it. 

Thanks for the thoughts I'm alredy doing angularJS, and been considering vue.js, seems like it could be a big competitor on the market. 
Yeah its pretty new though so probably not the best for big projects with a team right now. But at my job I pretty much handle any javascript... so I use what I want lol 
I've never heard of the domain but...

>Avada Hosting Features    
>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod ...

Probably says a bit.
I would ask for 50% payment up front and then 50% once you finish their work to avoid getting ripped off or wasting your time. While the domain looks pretty weird and shady as long as they are paying you just keep at it.
I so rarely visit this sub-reddit (though I should, there's tons of awesome content here! :-) ), but I just so happened to this week.

I have applied to a number of jobs on /r/forhire and got contacted by the Dimitriy fellow mentioned below a few months ago.  As described by others, he said that the work needed to be done immediately, asked for a portfolio, and then contacted me.  I was actually kind of bummed about it.

Well, a few minutes ago, he asks how I am with Wordpress and to see my portfolio.  He sends this staging link and a zip file called "ISSUES.zip" with jpgs and a Word doc.  The link was to the same domain you had mentioned.  I looked at it for about two seconds and then I remembered this thread!  Did a google search for 'zayaanibrahim site:reddit.com' and boom! This thread popped up.  Actually, the mobile link (?), but that's neither here nor there.

I sent him a Skype message with this link and the link to the /r/testimonials page.  Said 'sorry buddy' and heard nothing back :(

Thanks for the heads up about this. I just got scammed by another serial scammer on /r/forhire earlier this week, so I'm glad I didn't waste any time on this :-)


Yeah, on the first site I didn't think too much of it and I didn't even look to see what was on the main domain. This time I did and it obviously seems really fishy.
Yeah, that's probably the approach I'll start to take. Doesn't it seem weird, though, that these two (supposedly) different people both had sites set up on the same strange domain?
Glad this was able to help you out! Such a bummer that this guy continues to scam people and there's nothing that can be done about it. Fortunately there are genuine people on /r/forhire as well. I've done a couple jobs for one guy who's been great.
100% of the time a website, production website, having Lorem Ipsum text on it, is a major red flag.

- In this particular case, it has a bad Wordpress short tag showing [rev_slider_vc]

- The Services page is blank.

- Pizzas Ordered has a different number on the pages it shows up.

And as others have said, do a LITTLE bit of research, Google stalking and dig up things on potential clients. This kid is a scammer.
It seems it's a persons first and last name.

Admin Name: Zayaan Ibrahim

The next time you talk to either of the contacts, I would just straight up ask them if they are Zayaan themself or work for him or what.

From whois of domain

>Admin Name: Zayaan Ibrahim

>Admin Organization: Zayaan Ibrahim

>Admin Street: H. Hoama 10

>Admin City: Male

>Admin Postal Code: 20030

>Admin Country: IS

>Admin Phone: +354.9609163675

>Admin Email: xayaani@gmail.com

If you put the email into Facebook it will bring up the profile of the Zayaan guy directly. Seems to be some Indian kid who's job title is set to _CEO / Head Developer at Interact Maldives._


#UPDATE

Seems the kid is a serial scammer. Dont do anymore work for him. You should log into his hosting and delete any work you did.

Definitely, lesson learned.
Wow, that's unbelievable. Thanks for pointing this out. I'll have to be a lot more careful when looking for work on here. 
Review what you can, honestly. You're interviewing for what I'm doing. Honestly, there's not much to it. Just focus on what you know well, how you learnt might be important but be sure to mention about Version control and Ajax as it shows you've got drive to learn it. 


Okay, good advice. Can definitely do that - thanks!
This just looks to be a basic layout (3 columns) with some styles applied to (probably) a H1, H2 and UL HTML element.
>Does anyone recognise this as some kind of framework, or do you think it's just custom HTML? As very much a newbie at webdev I'd appreciate some pointers as to how to get a nice way to organise stuff like this quickly. Pure HTML, or is there a smarter way?

I agree with /u/-Alias-, this just looks like a styled page.  You're looking to try and throw together something like that, then I recommend checking out either [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) or [HTML 5 Boilerplate](https://html5boilerplate.com/).  They're both heavy frameworks that include almost everything you could need to put together a simple website and they both have copious amounts of documentation.

Best of luck to you!
Ah, thanks very much. Apologies for the tardiness!
Very belated, but thank you very much for the guidance!
Glad to be of assistance! (Also belated)
There is discussion about this outrage on /r/sysadmin
You work 100% on the server? Why don't you have a local set up you can work on? Do you not have any version control then? This is really not an excuse for not being able to work on something in development.
I think Linode is close to getting this under control. They are working on moving traffic to Level3 and gaining additional bandwidth to handle these attacks. Sadly, this takes time, as there are multiple parties involved. Linode Atlanta nodes to other data centers but this is not technically possible.

Linode has been great, I have confidence in their engineers, I would stay.

----
What's happening....

Basically all of Linode is under a massive Denial-of-Service attack. Atlanta is being impacted the worse, due to their upstream provider being unable to handle the massive traffic that is coming in. 

> <TecnoBrat> arthurfurlan: late last night, they moved off of their old bandwidth provider, onto a new one.  The new one has much better filtering capabilities.  However the link has significantly less bandwidth.  The attacks are ungoing.  They are actively working to mitigate those attacks.  They are also actively working to acquire more bandwidth.
Source: #linode@OFTC irc
Linode claims they will be taking care of affected customers. https://twitter.com/linode/status/683372345176797184
> Update - Our network operations and systems teams have been working non-stop for the last ~36 hours toward a resolution of the Atlanta outage. We have acquired a dedicated transit link that is now directly connected to the Linode network, and we are waiting for this transit provider to apply DDoS mitigation hardening, after which we believe that Atlanta should be restored to full service. We will keep you updated as things progress. 

[Source](https://linode.statuspage.io/incidents/cbbcjnhhpkgm)
I don't know what's going on with Linode. They're clearly having massive issues since there's been a lot of posts here recently about them.

My advice is to go with someone else for a while.
I have a copy in Git and a backup of the server. It's a fair amount of trouble getting setup again, that's why I was hoping this will pass soon. Plus, most of the down time has been optional work days for me so, so far, it hasn't been too bad. 
Okay, that is good news. I'll wait it out a bit longer then.

They are under a massive Denial-of-Service attack. Their upstream Atlanta provider sucks. They are moving to Level3 which should theoretically improve the situation. There isn't a hell of a lot they can do at this point. They are at the mercy of the attackers and upstream.
Yeah, I'm beginning to think I may have to switch. It's a major pain to move my dev sites and create a new server setup on another host. It may be several days of work for me to get everything moved so I was hoping I could just wait out the attacks. But, after losing several days of work I'm beginning to fear that I may have to start a move.
lol I will never understand people who work on servers.
Are the attackers doing it for profit? or?
You could use this time to look into vagrant for instance, which lets you take the entire server environment, develop on it locally and deploy it to any number of vagrant-compatible hosting providers.
Every provider you go with is going to be susceptible to a DDoS. It's just how the internet works currently. Even Digital Ocean is susceptible.

Any popular internet company is going to have to deal with this. Even namecheap.com had some DDoS issues in 2015.
I have my reasons and it works out well for me, except for the past few days. 
Or lolz?
It's pretty simple to do just by reading the API docs. Not sure what your having issues with?
[deleted]
Agreed. https://github.com/justintv/Twitch-API has pretty much everything.

- OAuth https://github.com/justintv/Twitch-API/blob/master/authentication.md
- Video list https://github.com/justintv/Twitch-API/blob/master/v3_resources/channels.md#get-channelschannelvideos
Guess I just had a brainfart. Everything I need is there, plus a little more. 
Really? Took me 3 seconds to find [this](https://github.com/justintv/twitch-api#index)

Lots of good documentation. As for embed, there's a button under the stream named "Share" that outputs:

    <iframe src="http://player.twitch.tv/?channel=CHANNEL_NAME" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" height="378" width="620"></iframe><a href="http://www.twitch.tv/CHANNEL_NAME?tt_medium=live_embed&tt_content=text_link" style="padding:2px 0px 4px; display:block; width:345px; font-weight:normal; font-size:10px;text-decoration:underline;">Watch live video from CHANNEL_NAME on www.twitch.tv</a>
Did you try upping the RAM to see if that fixes it?
You should be able to SSH https://blog.openshift.com/dive-into-openshift-with-ssh/

If you can you can copy over your file to the server and import it into MySQL from the command line.

Something like 

    mysql -uusername -ppassword database < file.sql
Have a look at backup buddy, I use it every day and its a lifesaver
Should have used BackupBuddy!
You mean in digital ocean ? I could do that but should a 1mb girl really take so much band width
I could import it.  But post importing my server starts showing a capacity issue 
Perfect thx
It could depending on what plugins your using. 

I'd at least see if it worked. It will be easier to debug if its working and you can always go back down in RAM if you figure out what's bottlenecking it. It is possible your old host had some sort of memcache set up for you on queries. 

I have seen some wordpress plugins do some pretty crazy things before. The problem with wordpress is it puts almost all of its data in 2 table (post and post meta) so you could have something pulling all the contents of both tables on every request. 

Consider looking it over with something like this https://wordpress.org/plugins/query-monitor/
/u/larivact You can find the latest build on chrome store. Let me know your feedback.
Doesn't seem to work. I made a redirect from `Equals http://requestly.in/` to `http://reddit.com` and it won't redirect.
/u/larivact Goot Catch. Actually "requestly.in" is a black listed domain and you can not modify anything on it. It is done intentionally and already captured as FAQ. Check these lines [shared.js] & [background.js]

Please try with this. Choose anything like `Url Contains facebook.com` to `http://reddit.com` 

[shared.js]: https://github.com/requestly/chrome-extension/blob/c0d627530f9493fed52e03d063f9862902997ab5/src/Shared/shared.js#L8
[background.js]: https://github.com/requestly/chrome-extension/blob/c0d627530f9493fed52e03d063f9862902997ab5/src/background/background.js#L132
I can't find your FAQ. Why would you blacklist any domain? If you have good reasons to blacklist it you should at least give an UI error message that this domain ain't allowed.

Your EQUALS option is of course 100% strict. But there is a problem: A browser automatically appends a slash when requesting a bare domain (in order to craft a valid HTTP request). But Chrome doesn't show it in the address bar. So if I go to `https://www.reddit.com` Chrome will request `https://www.reddit.com/` but will show the former.

This leads to the misbelieve that your extension doesn't work. So I propose that you automatically add that trailing slash if it isn't present for EQUALS with bare domains.
/u/larivact Thanks, Adding a "/' is a really nice suggestion. You seem to be catching all the nit picks of the tool. I appreciate your feedback. The simple reason for blacklisting the "requestly.in" domain is that Requestly rules are listed on `http://web.requestly.in` So if you redirect `Url Contains requestly.in` then you will never be able to open the rules page and it will result in user getting frustated to get back the rules page. Because he won't be able to deactivate the rule So he wont be able to create any more rule. I thought about this problem and could not find a better solution besides blacklisting some domains and requestly.in is done implicitly. You are right, I should throw an error message about this. One of the reasons I did not care much about this because I know requestly.in is my website and why would anyone redirect/block it. Anyways, Points taken:

* Publish FAQ Page (It is in draft)
* Compare Url after removing trailing "/" with Equals operator
* Show an error message for blacklisted domains

I really appreciate your honest feedback. Anything else ?
I didn't notice that the application is a website. I think it's weird. I would have it locally so that you access it via a `chrome-extension://` URL.

>Compare Url after removing trailing "/" with Equals operator

I wouldn't remove the trailing slash because it's existence can change the returned page. I would test if the entered URL is a bare domain and than append the trailing slash if it doesn't exist and than compare it.
> I didn't notice that the application is a website. I think it's weird. I would have it locally so that you access it via a chrome-extension:// URL.

Earlier, it used to open in `chrome-extension://URL` but I did it purposefully with this [task- Move requestly to web](https://github.com/requestly/chrome-extension/issues/39). 

Reasons being:

* It gives me more freedom over my html page
* I can modify any static content and it is available to users without bundling chrome extension zip and uploading to chrome store.
* I can run A/B tests now
* Since this is a web app, I can place text based ad later in the future in footer or in left navigation rail. That integration will be easy.
* I can provide updates/info/articles etc in the footer message.

That was the main intent.
OK. So I'm a full time front end developer and I am usually given PSD's that i just put together but when I am given a task this is my workflow. I do not consider myself a designer but sometimes when clients care more about functionality than looks they'll give it to me to design to cut cost.

* I draw using pen an paper some basic sketches, ensuring my really rough sketch has all the features the client requested. Its important in all stages to be mindful of how you're going to handle responsiveness. Don't just add something if you don't have a responsive solution planned.
* I then design a mobile and desktop site almost simultaneously in photoshop, every time i add an element to the desktop version i decide how I will handle it on the mobile and vice versa. I do this a few times until I have something I am proud of. I then have some photoshop documents with what I want to achieve
* I build for desktop first but every time i add a section i make it responsive, I have enough experience to know how it will work and how to make it easier for myself in the long run.  
* Then I do the client dance where I show it to them and they ask for tweaks etc etc.

So thats my workflow, I think its important to find what works for you though.

I sometimes use grid layouts and sometimes plan my own, I have a version of bootstrap I made by stripping everything out except their grid system which I frequently use. I would post it but it technically belongs to my employer. It depends on the site. Things like ecommerce are made significantly easier using bootstrap-type grid systems, on fullscreen one page sites i find it easier to make my own. 

Employers like javascript frameworks as well as css, i think it makes it easier to standardise the code so although its important to understand how it all works to improve how employable you are having a working knowledge of bootstrap is essential.

I dont use SASS/LESS because my employer doesn't yet have a coding standard for it. Not sure thats relevant but the point im making is make sure you can use standard css as well as SASS.


Hope that helps
- 1) I have a boilerplate for sketching containing my presentational assets and a package.json with gulp tasks, and a configuration file I use in every project. Furthermore there is a php file for sketching, a UI-kit, and a pattern lab. Every project starts with sketching in the browser with my boilerplate as a base. For larger projects I create a pattern lab that I later transfer to my html-templating. 

- 2) I do some sketches on cheap printer paper, mainly focused on the information architecture, where will what content be, on what page, and how can you get there?

- 3) I design â€œa single rule of text-widthâ€-first, usually about 40em. 

- 4) I never understood the need for grid systems, consinstensy leads to natural alignment in my experience. 

- 5) I don't use css frameworks, and sparingly use premade JS. I've never encountered a framework that doesn't force me to write awful html or is even remotely okay in terms of best practice. It's never a mistake to get a grasp of a language before using frameworks, you get a better understanding of what is happening, and how to evaluate a framework. 

- 6) if you're on a Mac, get sketch.app instead of/in addition to illustrator. Way better suited for interface design (and cheap).
Yeah, I am comfortable with standard CSS, which is why I am moving to SASS.

However, do you think I should just start using the bootstrap grid system. Every website I've seen and websites that I've recreated all used bootstrap for their grid/fluid layouts. 

I figured it's almost an industry standard to just use Bootstrap, should I make the switch?

Also do you know of any good resources for better understanding grid layouts?
I was thinking of doing the same thing. I've been making my current project one section at a time, but haven't been messing with mobile yet. I think I will take the approach of finishing a section on desktop, then make it work for mobile. 

Also do you have any good resources for reading about responsive design other than just practice?
I thought using grids was a standard for creating websites now.
I did the same as simonhearts cake but maybe went about it a little differently. I googled "create your own responsive grid sass" and used the Bootstrap naming convention (because that's what I'm used to). It works great but I only use it on my own projects.


My clients are mostly agencies that like to use Bootstrap and that is what I have encountered the most in the wild. I would say your time wouldn't be wasted using Bootstrap and you will most likely run into it a lot. It's very easy to pick up, just be sure to consider that there may be a solution to your problem built into Bootstrap before you start making your own classes to solve problems.
Its more prevalent because it speeds up the workflow for rookies, which saves the company money. Its all business after all
Are bootstrap and frameworks becoming an industry standard?


I ask because I'm wondering if I should take the time to learn to create responsive layouts from scratch without a framework or just keep learning bootstrap. 

Thanks dude 
You can hit the ground running with Bootstrap pretty quickly and you will find many clients who use it. I currently do a lot of small business WordPress sites and 90% of them require Bootstrap (at the client's request).


With that said, it is important to really understand what Bootstrap is doing and how responsive CSS works and how grids work. I think building out your own grid system will help you do that. Then, if you ever run into a client that is of the opinion that Bootstrap is too bloated or that all Bootstrap sites look the same you won't be stuck. 


I haven't gotten away from doing WordPress sites but I want to make sure that when I do I'm not limiting my opportunities because I only know how to build Bootstrap-based themes.


You'll find that a lot of jobs/clients utilize frameworks because it's a good way to get some standardization of code (to some extent) and it saves time in building out a site/app.
Awesome, thanks man !
Linter - for whatever language you need. 

Pigments - highlights any colors it sees in your code with that color. 

Sortable lines - adds a command where you can highlight some lines and it will alpha sort them. 

File type icons - adds icons to files in your tree

Minimap - (probably default plugin now) adds side minimap like sublime

Wordpress API - adds Wordpress functions into auto complete 
- activate-power-mode

Probably my most used addon.
I've only been using Atom for a month or so, and I originally got it to make using [JSLint](https://atom.io/packages/jslint) easier so that's the only community package I had installed. After reading this thread I now have highlight-selected, file-type-icons, pigments, and rainbow-tabs installed so thanks OP and commenters.

If anyone wants an opinion on "Why JSLint?" I guess JSHint is just too easy. I like a linter that challenges me and complains about everything.
I use atom both at home and work. 

I have to sync my changes with **sync-settings**. 

Here's mine https://gist.github.com/13e21666d59b0418e4f1
I wrote [a blogpost](http://www.threechords.org/blog/my-atom-setup/) recently with my setup (including fonts!).
Beautify, linters, pigment, files icons, block comments,  :$
I keep mine pretty simple.

* [editor-config](https://atom.io/packages/editorconfig): Helps keep consistent coding styles across projects. Extremely useful.
* [file-icons](https://atom.io/packages/file-icons): Adds icons for different file types.

* emmet
* highlight-selected
* linter
* minimap
* pigments
* seti-icons
* tool-bar

Not listing all the sub-plugins that depend on the ones above.

Question: I switched to Atom a few months ago from Sublime Text and I love it. BUT I still don't understand why it sometimes opens a file in a new window and sometimes not. Can't find a pattern. I want all of it in my active window. Any help?
[Atom beautify](https://atom.io/packages/atom-beautify) beautify your code

[docblokr](https://atom.io/packages/docblockr) generate function docblocks based on params

[editorconfig](https://atom.io/packages/editorconfig) [editorconfig.org](http://editorconfig.org/)

[hightlight-selected](https://atom.io/packages/highlight-selected) sublime like selection

[Linter](https://atom.io/packages/linter) linter infra package

[minimap](https://atom.io/packages/minimap) minimap, another sublime feature

[pastery](https://atom.io/packages/pastery) plugin for the sweetest pastebin, [pastery.net](https://www.pastery.net/)

[pdf-view](https://atom.io/packages/pdf-view) view pdf inside atom

[pygments](https://atom.io/packages/pigments) highlight colors

[toggle-quotes](https://atom.io/packages/toggle-quotes) toggle quotes from " to ' and vice versa
Vim-mode: because after getting used to it I can't really go back
Emmet: speeds up a few tasks
File Icons: makes it look nicer, also makes it easier to distinguish files
[local-history](https://atom.io/packages/local-history) - could be a life saver, if you are not commiting too often (or not using version control at all).
I tried using Atom for a bit. I used the Beautify and vim-mode plugins. I would have kept using it if vim-mode was fully functional.
Besides all the other ones already mentioned I also use this super handy package called [quickhyperlink](https://atom.io/packages/quickhyperlink) to quickly add a hyperlink to selected text from the clipboard data. 
https://github.com/AsaAyers/js-hyperclick is awesome.
I use the following:

* docblockr 
* linter
* minimap
* highlight-selected (and it's minimap extension)
* todo-show
* file-icons
* remote-FTP (can't live without this one!)
* angular-styleguide-snippets
Color-Picker and Emmet. 

Actually, I prefer VSCode because it's faster but can't figure out how to make it highlight .ejs files. If someone knows how please tell me. 
- [Seti UI](https://atom.io/themes/seti-ui) For the UI theme
- [Monokai Seti](https://atom.io/packages/monokai-seti) for the syntax theme.
- [atom-typescript](https://atom.io/packages/atom-typescript) For typescript intellisense
- [emmet](https://atom.io/packages/emmet) For quickly creating HTML skeletons
- [git-plus](https://atom.io/packages/git-plus) For doing basic git work within atom
- [gitignore-snippets](https://atom.io/packages/gitignore-snippets) Create gitignore files based on github's gitignore project
I have a fairly decent list myself:

[atom-beautify](https://atom.io/packages/atom-beautify) for cleaning up my slapdash code

[atom-bootstrap4](https://atom.io/packages/atom-bootstrap4) for quicker mockups and nice snippets

[mechanical-keyboard-1](https://atom.io/packages/mechanical-keyboard-1) because I have noise cancelling headphones

[minimap](https://atom.io/packages/minimap) for quickly jumping through my code

I also use [atom-material-syntax](https://atom.io/themes/atom-material-syntax) and [atom-material-ui](https://atom.io/themes/atom-material-ui)  because I like MD, but I might switch the syntax theme out for something else.
In addition to some that have already been mentioned, I use the following:

- [atom-material-ui](https://atom.io/themes/atom-material-ui)
- [autoclose-html](https://atom.io/packages/autoclose-html)
- [revert-buffer](https://atom.io/packages/revert-buffer)
- [terminal-plus](https://atom.io/packages/terminal-plus)
... less-than-slash because I'm lazy and developed that bad habit years ago.

Other than that, pretty much what everyone else has said: emmet, something for react/jsx (to highlight the syntax... don't remember the name), linter-eslint, and sass-linter.
Git Plus is very, very handy!
I use the Sublime Text Plugin
Is atom ever going to NOT be slow as hell?
I had to disable mini-map as it was making Atom unusable for me :/ I'd open a file and come back in 20 minutes or so.
Just FYI, I don't think minimap is a default plugin. I had to install it just a minute ago.
[Link](https://atom.io/packages/activate-power-mode) for the lazy
Holy shit, that's awesome. 
I switched to VS Code from Atom. I really wish I had something like that.
> activate-power-mode

I'm using that for all live coding demos now.
This thread is going to make me try Atom when I get back to work on Monday. But mostly this. Really just this.
Lol this is pretty cool, but I can't imagine using it for more than 2 minutes
Maybe describe it in your comment so that lazy people like me wouldn't have to click on the link in /u/Zetaphor's comment to see what it is?
To anybody who installs Emmet and doesn't enjoy the fact it just splattered key bindings all over the place, try [Emmet simplified](https://atom.io/packages/emmet-simplified)
Do you use jade-autocompile or not worth jt/?
Great list. I have been on sublime for as long as I can remember and have it customized to my liking. Migrating from ST2 to ST3 was painless. I'm not sure it would be as easy to migrate to Atom from ST3.
> I'm considering an alternative since I only use it for JavaScript and this package weights 116MB

How do you find the total file size?
I think there's a package called atom-prettify or something like that.
> docblockr

This is a really great plugin.
does vim-mode for atom have the standard vim modes such as normal mode, command mode, insert mode, and visual mode?
Interesting. Any big reason to use this over node in the cli?
Ooh I like this. Thanks.
I know that it's pretty common to dv folks for linking to blogs, but I though this was a well done post, especially the included gifs.

Nice work.
thanks, that was a handy post
Upvote for block comments
> git-log[3] : A quick graph of your commits on a project.

Ooh, that looks rad Thanks for the hat-tip.
Hmm maybe it depends where the file is: if it's relative to the project folder or just a file on the file system
Honest question. Why use Atom with ViM mode instead of ViM itself?
This is cool, but it seems like training wheels for learning bad habits.
[deleted]
It's not slow for me...  I don't install a shit ton of plugins though; just what I only will really use.  I mean, it's not as fast as Sublime Text, but it isn't *slow*.  
It's gotten better. The startup time is definitely slower, but once it's open it's comparable to Sublime Text on a fast machine. 
[deleted]
I use sublime and I always find it to be more of a gimmick than anything. It looks cool but it doesn't really do anything for me. I always turn it off
Why did you switch to VS Code? I recently left Atom as well because of how slow it is. I downloaded VS Code but haven't really used it much.
This is the reason I'm still using Sublime Text. It just feels a lot faster
I use [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) with [gulp-jade](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-jade) to compile it.  
PS: what does **jt/** mean?
I transitioned from ST3 to atom about 6 months ago and it was painless for me. I still miss the speed that ST3 had but I think in the long run atom will surpass ST3 in almost every aspect.  
  
If you're comfortable with ST3 stick to it, it's great.
I know it at least has insert and command. It's pretty amazing with a customizable text editor like atom. Makes coding enjoyable and efficient
I use it for Python and Ruby inline in the editor. 
Nope.
At first it was because I needed to use jade autocompile, an add on which basically does what it says on the tin. More recently I stick with atom because it has a lot of functionality which is not present, or difficult to setup in vim. 
Hey it worked! Thanks a lot kind stranger. 
Ah so it's the plugins...
I use it to quickly find parts of code via comment blocks that I can see on the mini map as a block that isn't code... But I would rather have the screen real estate back and use something like Visual Studio's... It's the drop down where you can select a method and it takes you to it, it's just above the code section in VS.... Of course there aren't methods in HTML or CSS and not really in Js, so for web people mini map is more the way to go.
It can be really useful. Not sure why you would turn it off, it doesn't harm anything. But I guess maybe it hurts performance if you don't have a good computer.

You can quickly find parts of the code (like comment blocks), and it's a 100% replacement for a scroll bar. It's essentially a more feature enriched scroll bar.

Not to mention it looks awesome.
Same here. I do not get the appeal of mini map. Mini map is always hidden and so is the file/project explorer.
buttery smooth compared to atom.
Well, I started working at a Microsoft shop and had to use VS 2015. 


I continued using Atom, but after a while I didn't like the syntax highlighting like I did for VS, and it's kind of slow, so I tried VS Code again and really liked it. The only thing I would like is open files in tab form like in Atom, plus a few other things. I wish there were more plugins for VS Code though.

(Not who you replied to, but my 2c)

I use Atom (and some JetBrains) for personal learning/practice around JS/Python/etc, but mostly VS Code for work because my company does a lot of .NET. Sufficient plugins definitely make Atom a little poky but VS Code is pretty smooooth. 
I really don't understand are y'all using laptops from 2002? 

Atom speed has been plenty fine on my 2012 MBP.

VS Code is amazing if you use typescript.
When it's 0500 and you woke up but yet an hour ago you won't be very accurate with your tiping.

Or youe English 
That makes sense.
Conflicting key bindings? 

I'll say check out the issues on git
This is pretty much what cmd + r does in sublime text
Eclipse does this for HTML/CSS/JS 
Seems atom is slow and crashy on decent computers, so a tiny bit of help is kinda worth it sometimes.
Well I have a small screen on my laptop so if I have a split view or something space gets tight. Also I use the go to anything search to move from function to function typically so that sort of nullifies any benefit of an enhanced scrollbar.
I turned it off because it takes up space and I didn't use it.
And yet both are electron apps. I hope GitHub is studying the crap out of vs code.
There are. They're called extensions though.
I absolutely love jetbrains but it's soooo slow. 
VS Code for awhile and you'll see. It's not likes its slow, it's just not fast. It feels laggy and jittery all the time.

At work I'm on a 2012 Mbp quad core i7 with ssds and 8gb of ram. At home I have rmbp with core i7, 8gb, ssds and discrete graphics. They aren't crappy computers. Atom is just too slow. It's made with JavaScript, html and css; it's not going to be nearly as fast as something written in objective c like vs code
Haha ok, makes sense now.
I'm not pressing any keys to open a file. Are you using Atom, too?
And atom
True, but the original comment was about Sublime text...
I know, but there aren't nearly as many. Thats the problem.
Ugh, same. 

On the same token, I was so relieved to have VS Code become available as a C#/.NET editor on OS X so I could put away Xamarin Studio. Launching an IDE that fat to edit a single .cshtml file or something felt pretty silly. 
I've never had a problem with jetbrains being slow, save for initial indexing of a project... What product are you using from them? 
VS code is written in typescript using Electron, same as Atom.

Why would Microsoft use Objective C? I mean, MS is a lot cooler these days, but they would never use an apple product over an MS product, not when they could use C#.
[Wait, but VS code is written in Typescript/JS, CSS, and HTML too.](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode) 
Actually VS Code is written using Electron, formerly Atom Shell, the exact JavaScript+CSS tool Atom created for its UI. If Atom didn't exist VS Code wouldn't either, and they're both basically browser windows rendered as desktop apps.
Yup. I use keys to open my files. 

I use ctrl-t to open any files in project. 

Ctrl-n to open any other file (and this will always open in a new window unless that file is in the project folder)
Yeah guess so. Pretty relevant for atom though ^.^
Just edit it in vim if it's such a hassle.
PHPStorm. I suspect it's probably my javascript linter though. I have several hundred files of JS in my project.
lol that's too good. I feel bad for the front-end dev who did that, but man, a framework that popular by a company that large... and no responsive. that's absurd.
They need a good ol' col-xs-12.
I see they're following material design. Very nice. /s
shit's fucked?
Btw here's the URL: https://angular.io/docs/js/latest/
css is awesome
The Angular 2 site is better than the Angular 1 site at least. [This](http://i.imgur.com/P31pVGt.png) is what angularjs.org looks like on my Nexus 6.
Are they eating their own dog food and found a bug?
There is an old saying - carpenters door is usually broken.
That is what happens when it's 4:55 pm on a Friday and someone just wants to get show and tell done and go home.
It's in beta, don't worry...
LOL, they are not in design business :)
American web developers. What would you expect...
Not exactly sure what is the proper solution since I'm **not** 100% confident in my flexbox best practices. It seems that the parent container should be set to have 

    [layout=row]{
                 flex direction: column
            }

 for mobile, then cleanup any spacing/margin issues.

*Edit missing a word
It's possible to do this with angular material, they just didn't. 
How is that worse than what OP posted?
I hope thats it lol like I hope when they look at that they don't even feel it's a problem.
He only means that it isn't optimized for mobile, but I agree with you. If a website has a shitty responsive design, better stay with the original style.
* contact the causes you support. Ask if they need the expertise of a web developer. You might be pleasantly surprised -- particularly at the local level, TONS of non-profits (particularly in smaller towns) need help on the digital front.

* Check out [FreeCodeCamp](http://www.freecodecamp.com/). It's billed as a "learn to code while helping non-profits" kind of thing. Since you already know how to code you can probably hop right in to helping.

* Do your own thing. Have an idea for a useful app / site for a cause you support? Make it anyway and then shoot it over to them when you're done. Worse case scenario you have an extra cool portfolio piece. 
You could try contacting non-profits and charities in your area and offer free web development.
Check out Idealist.org. That's pretty much the Dice.com for non-profits/not-for-profits/B Corps.
A colleague of mine pointed this out to me the other day: https://medium.com/swlh/stop-dailyui-start-fixui-e685acc6858f#.5brfo969v
Find projects you support on github and contribute to them? :)
ELI5: Is a career or freelance in web dev a good choice for continued job security and $$$?
http://jekyllrb.com/docs/drafts/
Yes, like I said I know how to do that bit, any idea for the other part?

>How do I put some html pages under "myPosts/Folder" and have them export to "_site/myPosts"? (and not "_site/myPosts/Folder")
Add the following to your `_config.yml`:

    collections:
        old_posts:
            output: true
            permalink: /articles/:path

Now create a `_old_posts` directory in your jekyll root folder and there you go everything in this directory will get rendered into the articles folder.
Fuck. Thank you so much!
Hey

I have been learning Elixir for the last few weeks and decided to code up a project over the weekend.

I built GitChecker, which is an open source tool that aggregates statistics about Github projects

In case anyone is interested, you can check out the source code, as it It might be useful for people looking to integrate the mentioned technologies.

Any questions and feedback is more than welcome!
I have been searching for something like this the whole time. Thanks!

Why are you exporting you success and failure actions.. They are only used internally, right?
Yeah, before starting I also spent a while searching for a project (more than a boilerplate) using a similar stack, but without any luck.

Good question and I have no idea hehe, as you're right - They're only used internally here.


Looks very nice, would like to see a version for Sublime Text and PHPStorm.
These are gorgeous. I second that I'd love to see a version for JetBrains products.
Thank you :)
Really like the themes, definitely want to see them made available to WebStorm.
They can't not pay you if you're doing work but you could pitch that they would only pay you for time spent doing work and that you would be very careful about tracking the time you spend learning vs working.

Also, you are part of the freelancewriting sub - you could make sure to include that you are a good writer and can be a strong contributor in that area even if your development skills are below where they may want them. 
Why can't they not pay him, unpaid internships are a thing. 
It depends on the country you live in.  In some countries unpaid internships are illegal since it is essentially free labour.
[deleted]
I have seen all kinds of unpaid internships. They are not common for developer jobs but I have allot of designer friends and there are all kinds of unpaid design internships out there.
Pretty hard to qualify for an unpaid internship in the U.S. Specifically, I see criteria #6 being the biggest hurdle.

Look into using bootstrap, it's a framework that will give you everything you need to make a website. Also anything you're attempting to do will have already been attempted by other people who have documented it on stack overflow. 

Bootstrap is phenomenally documented itself and mobile first out of the box. It will save you time and headaches.
Learn to use a grid based layout framework like Bootstrap or Foundation. I personally prefer foundation, but bootstrap is more widely used. 

If you are familiar with SASS, you can quickly build responsive layouts in Foundation, but you can do so with CSS as well. 
Might be repeating what is already said but look in twitter bootstrap. Understand how their css and html elements are designed. Also try to understand the grid system and how responsiveness is achieved using columns, rows and media queries. If you get the basics right, it would not be difficult to develop.
Can you put what a framework is into Laymen's terms? I've looked into frameworks before and I'm pretty shit at understanding new concepts in any other way than conversation
So, would I basically have to scrap the HTML and CSS I'm using and redevelop it if i were to choose the framework route? If I have to, I have to, but I just want to be sure that I'm not wasting the efforts that I've already made
From Wikipedia : BootstrapÂ is a free and open-source collection of tools for creating websites and web applications. It contains HTML- and CSS-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation and other interface components, as well as optional JavaScript extensions.

Basically, there are a lot of things that we create every time we do a website, buttons, forms, navigation... When you use a framework instead of having to create those things from scratch you can just use the frameworks already created modules. Need a navigation, they've already built it, and tested it thoroughly it works pretty much everywhere on every size screen in every modern browser. By using a bunch of the modules they've already created and tested you can quickly put together a website. 
You can do whatever a framework like Bootstrap does with your existing HTML, but it will take a lot more effort. 

With a framework, you can sprinkle some classes and you are good to go..
Okay thanks for breaking it down I appreciate it man
What are some of the best resources that a beginner could use to get started with a framework such as bootstrap? I've been looking at some of the documentation and it all flies over my head.
No problem, bootstrap isn't a silver bullet, but can get you prototyping fast, also it's used so widely that whenever you come to an issue, just Google it and you'll get information on that exact issue. 

Also I'm sure there are tons of tutorials on YouTube to get you pointed in the right direction. Good luck.
Codeschool has a great intro on Responsive Web Design. It teaches you how responsive design works. Now you calculated things if you were to do responsive web by hand. 

Take that first. 

Then they have a good primer on Bootstrap as well.  
Thank you man, I appreciate it a lot.
Here's what I have: http://codepen.io/kgm/pen/MKayKv?editors=110

The problem I'm running into when using the markup you would like to use, it that I have no way of selecting the label when the input is check. Some kind of parent selector would be useful:

    input:checked < label { }

Here you would select the LABEL element that has the child of INPUT that is CHECKED.

You could use something like this polyfill: https://github.com/Idered/cssParentSelector

The syntax is a little different however to mimic the proposed CSS4 spec. Here you would use '!' to specify the parent element and apply the styling to that. E.g:

    label! > input:checked { }

So without the '!' you would be selecting the INPUT that is CHECKED and that is a child of LABEL, applying the styling to the INPUT, however with the '!' you apply the styling to the parent LABEL.
Why don't you want to use IDs??
    label>input[type="checkbox"] {
     all: unset;
     display: inline-block;
     width: 1em;
     height: 1em;
     margin: .5em 1em 0 0;
     background: #f00 url('about://blank') no-repeat center center/contain;
     transition:113ms ease-out 10ms;
    }
    
    label>input[type="checkbox"]:checked {
     background: #00f url('about://blank') no-repeat center center/contain;
    }

[Codepen](https://codepen.io/dizzyzane/pen/zrNZrW)

Set about://blank to your URL/dataURI of choice and #f00 and #00f to your preferred fallback colors.

One more layer of difficulty. We are using FontAwesome for the checkbox.
Then ask if you can change to a more customisable SVG image.
I teach at a dev boot camp, and so can illuminate a little bit.

The short answer is that 9-5 in class + 7 or more hours of homework time is usually an exaggeration, but not by much. This is often the result of inefficiencies in both instruction and learning. But it's pretty common to see students doing upwards of 3-4 hours per night of homework, and the course itself is generally all-consuming for all but the most prepared of students.

When I teach, I spend very little time lecturing (relative to other instructors I've observed) -- usually about 45-90 minutes per day -- and students spend the rest of the day working. At night, they finish up their work from the day and do a little bit of prep-work for the following day (usually watching a video or doing some reading or writing). But we also waste almost no time during the day.

Most instructors spend more time lecturing than I do. Most instructors also are not as decisive of lesson planners as I am.

The longer answer is that you'll be learning a lot of new information in a very short period of time, and the only way you can really do that is if you're fully set up for success. This means you don't have to worry about money, or food, or many obligations other than studying. We've had a handful of students drop out of our course, all because they had a parent or family member dealing with life-or-death health issues.

If you spend your time in class being distracted, it'll be harder to learn. So the question I have for you is whether you think you can go to class and be fully present while also looking out for your dad. I don't say this in a judgmental way or to make you feel bad, but rather because I want you to assess your own needs as best you can. Do you think you can go to class, learn, take care of your dad, and also take care of yourself? Who's in your support network, and who can help out (either with taking care of your dad or with taking care of you)?

One way for you to gauge this is to make a real go of the prep-work over the next week or so. Even if it's over your head, start from the beginning, go back through it, and dig in as best you can. If you find that you can make progress and that you can successfully compartmentalize things, great. If not, consider delaying your enrollment. I hear that you don't want to delay forever (which makes sense), but consider it.

It may also be worthwhile to talk with your father about this. Would he be open to, say, hiring someone to help him out around the house, or otherwise finding some sort of arrangement that frees you up a little bit?

It also may be worthwhile to talk with your instructor -- if you start class, find out that you need to stop (because your father needs you), can you re-enroll in a later class? If so, what additional cost exists?

As for what you can do, study-wise, to help yourself be fully prepared:

1. Go through the prep-work material
2. Make sure you understand input, output, variables, if-statements and conditionals, loops, lists/arrays, hashes/dictionaries/object literals/associative arrays (ruby/python/javascript, respectively), and defining and calling methods
3. Make sure you've got a decent grasp of the most common data types: strings, integers, floats, booleans, and what operations you can perform on them to create them and to modify them
4. Start building a regular schedule, including time for meal preparation. If you can spend an afternoon on a weekend making all of your lunches and dinners for the week, you'll be in great shape. Work, incrementally, towards living by this schedule.
5. But seriously: talk with your father about this. Have a frank discussion in which you two make known (and acknowledge) your respective needs.

It's not the end of the world if you postpone. It's not the end of the world if you don't postpone. It's also not the end of the world if you get midway through class and figure out that you need to drop the course and pick it back up next cohort. None of these things will doom you. I promise.

Good luck. I hope you have a really great time with this :)
What type of boot camp is it specifically?

The week long 3 course one I took at a tech college over the summer was 8-10 hour days but less than 3 hours of "homework", mostly based on finishing up projects during the day that we didn't complete. They realized our brains were fried ... 
I just finished a 3 month bootcamp.  They only homework it required was TOPS an hour of reading on the next day's material.  But (I imagine) all bootcamps are different.  If you are already registered, you should just call/email and ask how much time is expected of you outside of class.... They should be happy to help.  No one here can really give you that answer.

If the prework is over your head, you need to start studying ASAP.   I had a year of college courses under my belt and I was surprised how quickly they moved through some material.  The good thing about web dev is there are so many resources available, the only barrier is you actually putting the work in.

If you are struggling with any concepts in particular, I'd be happy to help the best I can.
Looks like both of us are in the same boat. I decided to build a product on the side. It might take 6 months or so... But if it takes off, I'll quit my job.. If it fails, well... Interview fodder. So it's a win win. 
Find some let projects on Github that interest you - its a great way to "peer learn" and you can stay up to date on literally anything. It's also better than just portfolio work since its actively contributing towards a meaningful goal. 
I've done alright on upwork. Magento is my thing and I fix a ton of shady stuff written by the $8hr guys.
[deleted]
Get a portfolio site up, post in subreddits like /r/shopify or other ecommerce plattforms, checkout r/forhire, do some guestposts on blogs with links to your site. etc.

As an alternative to Elance, Freelancer and Co you can check out https://giglib.com ... The waiting list is getting pretty long by now but it is an option for the future.
Upwork worked so well for me! Started off with smaller website jobs for randoms and then I did a site for an seo company which they loved and I actually now work part time privately for them (online) and making more money from my part time job than my full time job! .. Just do amazing jobs for clients on Upwork and you might have the same luck! 
Yea, I'd rather find more app development type work than one off bug fixes. 
A well-built portfolio site and a professional/informative LinkedIn will get people/agencies to reach out to you. My best clients have come to me from those two sources/a combination of the two.


Elance/Upwork can be avoided if you already have some good experience.
Try just posting an ad in /r/forhire, but be upfront about your skillset and amount of time you can commit to.

What I find though, is that many casual devs often promise 10-20 hours a week, then it slips to 5 hours, and before you know it you've heard nothing for months

You're left suddenly asking yourself why you bothered to hire a casual amateur instead of someone who wanted a more full-time position

I wouldn't bother with elance. You're competing with very cheap labour from Asia and Eastern Europe. 
You'd need to sell your soul for a year just to build up enough feedback that you can charge a worthwhile rate
It's really experimental at this point, but I wanted to practice TDD and this really fit nicely for that :D
Exactly the same situation here! Good luck!
Good luck! You can do it. 
Best of luck to you too Rhino :) 
Thank you Mr. Robot!

>and a way to store password securely

argon2, scrypt, bcrypt. In order of preference. Anything conflicting against this should be tossed in the bin.
POST your username & password from the game client to your PHP script using an HttpRequest from C# -- preferably over https. Hash/salt your passwords server-side using bcrypt before storing them in the database. You'll likely want to use PDO for your PHP database connection.

If you're on PHP5.5+ look into the password_hash and password_verify functions.

As disclosure5 mentioned below disregard anything telling you to hash passwords with md5, sha1, sha256, etc.
What justanotherc said, but also I would suggest for the sake of security that when you send over the Username and Password, dont do it as 2 parameters such as "Username=ABC" and "Password=XYZ" instead do something that isn't obvious at first glance such as Param1=(EncryptedVersion of UserName +"|" + Password) 
Thanks a lot, that's what I'm looking for :)

I still have a question :

Should I resend the password with each message to the server?
If not how would I ensure the message comes from a client that is connected and not from a hacker that just "say" he's connected?
> EncryptedVersion of UserName

Let SSL deal with encryption. You're not going to implement a client side that's of any benefit.


Thanks! But if I encrypt the password + user, I need an encryption key in my client, right?
Anyone who decompile the app will have access to this key, so I don't know if it's enough secure.
The conventional method would be to use sessions. Once you authenticate the user set up a session variable. You could send the password each time as long as you're just keeping the password in memory and not storing it insecurely. But sessions are better. 
Yeah don't worry about this. If you're using https (ssl) the data is already encrypted in transit. 
Sounds like you need to a more specific database to query. Even if you make this work its a kludge to use Wikipedia to get a list of bands. Perhaps you should look into MusicBrainz? Its free for non-profit projects and reasonably priced beyond that.

Dont bury yourself in technical debt. It's very, very tempting to take shortcuts when you're trying to protect your own margins, and write sub-standard code. This will almost always come back to bite you, or your client. Write a feature, walk away. Come back the next day. Still understand what you did? Walk away. Come back again the next day. Still understand what you did? Great. If no in either case, refactor immediately. Invest time now while the *problem* is still fresh in your mind, but the solution is not, so that you save time later when not even the *problem* is fresh in your mind anymore and you have to add a feature (which you charge them for) or fix a bug (which will cost *you* money).


Depends what you mean by "contractor" - are you placed by an agency and simply supposed to follow instructions, or are you self-employed and coming in as a consultant? Big difference in expectations there on both sides.

> This is often due to things scope creep, lack of overall project management, too many agencies involved

What is the problem here though - are you saying you end up not being paid for your time, or that the end result is not what was expected by the client, or both?

Either way, it sounds like you need to document things more carefully. Keep all emails, every verbal meeting should be followed up by a summary email to document decisions and expectations, including if any have changed from before and how that impacts the work required.

Try to form these relationships & exchanges not only with the people who decide who gets hired, but those usually a bit higher up who are waiting on the end result. As a contractor you're ultimately replaceable and expendable, but my best experiences have been when I've become more personally involved with a company, its staff and managers. When they know you as a person, and they know your quotes and documentation are accurate and valuable, the "client" (i.e. the collection of people making up a company) is more likely to seek your input, less likely to mess you around.

Always come across as competent and professional - in your manner, speaking, writing. Try to give each person you interact with something of value they can use. If the work itself doesn't go as planned - well, that happens all the time in business and if they're smart they know it. But the easier you are to deal with and the more you come across as someone professional who provides a lot of "added value" along with your work, the more understanding the client tends to be.

> I have yet to be able to win a contract where a client agrees to adopt an agile process where only one of budget, timeline, or scope is fixed (most want all three fixed, which is always unrealistic). 

I think it's unrealistic not to expect a client to want certainty. Agile can come across as wishy-washy to those not familiar with its intent. I think agile is something which can more easily be implemented in a company with an existing I.T. dept. than something a client will accept from a contractor. Most clients just want a fixed quote and a guarantee they'll get what they want. How the details of that are negotiated and fixed is up to you as a contractor.

It's up to you to make a case for something taking longer than the client might expect. I.T. is full of the unexpected. But the more the client knows and **trusts** you, the easier you will find it to make your case when essentially being that car mechanic who tries to tell you he's found xyz extra things wrong and it will cost $$$. The difference between you being happy or not is whether you **trust** your mechanic.
> [Fuck you pay me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h3RJhoqgK8)

Not a fan of the "fuck you xyz" approach to communication, but I think the best messages in that video are "be professional", "be [i.e. appear] confident", and make sure both you and and client understand what is being delivered, when and how much for.

I would also add "document everything", "communicate effectively" and **bill the client incrementally** - not all at once - so that: a) you can gauge quickly how they are about paying for things, and b) if they don't pay for something, you stop work right then and there and what you potentially lose is not the whole sum but a small part of it.

ed: To explain the reasoning of that last bit - it doesn't matter if you have a contract or not, if you are a sole trader whose jobs aren't worth enough to make filing a law suit worthwhile. Access to, and cost of, the courts depends on what country you're in. If you know full well that you wouldn't be able to "follow up" if a contract is broken, then your best approach is to mitigate the cost of potentially broken contacts. Allow for it in your hourly rate, the same as you'd allow for holiday breaks, quiet periods, etc.

So work out what you should charge per hour, and make contracts where the client agrees to be billed incrementally, eg. weekly. Make sure the contract includes **billing cycle**, ie. 30 days, 60 or whatever. If client misses a payment deadline, work stops and maybe you lose a relatively small payment.

Depending on your r\/ship with a client, don't necessarily be too strict about stopping work if a client has been good to you; I find the best clients are ones where you both give each other flexibility, and it's hard to find clients who treat you well - treat them well too) .
> Not a fan of the "fuck you xyz" approach to communication

Generally I would agree with you, but: unless you've been in the situation(s) I've been in for the past couple of years, dealing with some of the most boneheaded individuals and companies on the planet, you may not appreciate how valuable the "fuck you xyz" approach is. :)
What technologies are you using?

There are a lot of different ways you could tackle this depending on your requirements.  A lot of frameworks/toolkits provide this functionality out of the box.
I think the best way to display information about housing is in quick info cards. Think of it like a baseball card or pokemon card. Just a picture (or the ability to view several pictures) and some of the key information about each apartment.

I would suggest just adding some key information about each building/apartments directly underneath the pictures on the front page. As a someone who has recently been liberated of the evil that is student housing.....The information I always looked for was the price per month/semester, # bedrooms, # of occupants per apartment, Is it furnished? how so?, any utilities included? which ones?

Stick to the most important information on the homepage and let the call to action allow them to get more information.

I looked into building a website for a local landlord and thought it would be a great idea to include a blueprint of the apartments and video walk-through. I feel like these two programs would provide a lot of useful information to any renter.

That's my two-cents

"Screenshots" on the right.
I don't think that's right, if you hover over that box it tells you that it captures screenshots while you are recording.

What i am looking for is a feature that they used to have where they would record your Frames Per Second and graph those, similar to load times. You could see elements that were dropping your FPS in this way and help diagnose website stuttering etc.
> What i am looking for is a feature that they used to have where they would record your Frames Per Second and graph those, similar to load times.

http://i.imgur.com/57L1Mf6.png
Sure, but when you actually record something that doesn't do anything. I can't figure out how to interact with it and actually pick apart the different elements causing dips in the breakdown like you can with load times. It used to be possible with the old interface.
Use this 

bhamrick.com/2013/04/18/setup-a-wildcard-tld-using-dnsmasq-on-os-x/

P.s. Dnsmasq works on all *nix software, mac, Ubuntu, bsd etc
Could be a bug in Chrome.

Are you sure it's the wildcard entry making it happen?  Try removing it.

Did you ever install a [proxy configuration](http://serverfault.com/a/622563) into Chrome?
I actually did already. It worked great. And thank you.

But my question here is how on earth the page resolved in Chrome *without* it. I just want to understand.
my gut reaction is that 10 or 15 years ago, the bar for buying stuff online was a lot lower. Nowadays people's expectations are a lot higher.

Let's assume it's a 1 billion online market size. If they can get 5% of that with the best website they can make, paying a million dollars per year is great.

There's a lot of different specializations for making a website. Back-end developers, front-end developers, UX designers, visual designers, interaction designers, marketers, etc.

You're right that someone can just make a shopify e-commerce website with one person, but there are real limitations to that.

I'd love to know more about the project, but without it, I can't tell you why they're spending as much as they are.
Did they have a retail store too?
but people don't care about the design of a website, they care about the product. A good example of this is Craigslist. It has a very simple and basic design and it's probably the most visited classified ads website in the world. Why? because its product (content) is great. No one cares about the design and colors or font styles on Craigslist.
no
craigslist is one example, and I think they're actually hindered by their design.

It's proven, good design/websites make more money.

http://www.goodui.org/evidence/


Yes, you need a value-prop, like "buy stuff", but when given the choice, better designed and developed websites win.
Don't you think if a website, which has a basic design, starts selling iPhones 20% off the market price, people won't buy iPhones from it? Will people go to a fancy website and pay full price?

No. People care about the product or content. A good example of content is porn websites or websites which publish erotic stories. People couldn't care less about the design of the website. If the website has the video that you want, it wins.

Another example is the websites which publish pirated movies. Look at their designs...
Development and design are just multipliers. People care about both.
no. I gave you good examples.
I am nearly in the same boat. I really just started to get into code. There are some great online resources to learn from. I am using www.codecademy.com right now. I build some basic sites on the side and am using each one to learn more and more so I can keep building better sites. 

I would say do some free courses online, see if you enjoy it and then go from there. 

I doubt I will go back for a degree just because I will likely only do this on the side but if you want to do it full time and get a degree I don't think it's too late. Most work until 65...thats a lot of time wasted not doing what you love in my opinion. 


I did the same, but I'm 28 now. Was always interested in HTML and web. Just the way you can inspect a page and start hacking away made me really like it, from the age of about 15. But I never actually learnt CSS or JS or any of it. Just procrastinated and did video editing and media at College and Uni.
Left Uni thought fuck it, I don't want this. Applied for all of the shittest of 'coding' jobs.

E-commerce assistants and static HTML writing for editorials and such.

A lot of old systems out there with no way for talented writers / editors to write their own articles online without knowing HTML. So these bigger more corporate old school companies hire people to turn Word docs into html for their crappy articles to look nice on their site. Just because they don't want to front up the cash to change the full system.

Anyways long story short, did that for few years. Completely self taught HTML/CSS/JS. Now frontend developer at a more tech-wise company, write JS most of the time. Love it.


TLDR;

Get any shitty job where you can spend your 30 to 40 hours time in the frontend.

In your freetime do things you know you can do at new job that they won't let you spend time on.

Wait two/three years. Done. At least Junior Dev.

You can definitely go to school working full time.  Especially if you go part time at the local CC, or even online.  I am working on my second degree (I am 28); this time for Computer Science online and I absolutely love it.  I am working full time myself, and worked full time on my first degree as well.  I find that going to school online gives you way more flexibility than at a brick and mortar university, especially working full time.  

In my current Comp Sci degree, I took a Web Dev class my second term and absolutely loved it.  I am branching out in multiple directions for mobile & web development (apps and websites). 

My advice for getting started with web development is to build your own website.  I approached mine like an informal resume, showcasing your skills (through the website design) and also boasting about yourself (like a resume).  As far as tools to help you learn on your own:

* [Free Code Camp](http://www.freecodecamp.com/#)
* [Code Academy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/web)
You don't have to go corporate, but as you learn, you should rapidly try to involve yourself with a community as soon as possible. Teaching yourself is how you're going to learn most of what you need to know, and other devs who are struggling with the same kind of problems are the best resource. 


An agency type gig is just the place where you will most easily be able to find this situation, but you could just as easily go to meetups or help in open source projects (documentation is an easy place to get in with 0 skills in big projects). The key piece is to expose yourself to group work and to give yourself some human resources to plumb for help when you hit titchy, idiosyncratic stuff that doesn't solve itself with a Stack Overflow search.
I think most of the other comments covered it from the actually getting out there and learning it aspect, the one thing I will say is a major part of development is problem solving. It's tough to just go and start some company when there is nothing that needs to be done (if that makes sense). The best thing to do is look for problems in your life, or other's that could be addressed by something you could develop, and then take it from there. Don't create a problem just to solve it. Good luck! 
...

What are you trying to do? What problem do you need solving that's not solved right now? "I need a framework" is not enough information to go on. 
Do you want to do web design, as in how the site looks and operates in terms of navigation and usage? Or would you be interested in also understanding how to collect data and do various operations on it? The former is front end, while the latter is back end.  Take Reddit, for example - the basic features of how a subreddit looks and how you navigate the site is front end, while the features of what data is collected - to create a user, make a post, comments, subreddits, etc is back end.  You can do either or both - that's full stack.  So what do you want to do? The framework depends on the aspect you're focusing on.
> I'm going in front end.

Wonder what you meant by this?
I recommend you something which doesn't force you to use a certain structure like AngularJS or ReactJS. Start with jQuery. Easy to understand and good to start with. When you're getting to bigger projects, you learn whats the ups and downs of jQuery, especially when you work with a team. 

Then I recommend you a Framework like ReactJS or AngularJS (I prefer AngularJS, but maybe you should go with ReactJS because I think in the future there will be more Frameworks like ReactJS because Angular 2.0, which is now in beta, is pretty similar to it.)
But when you go with such huge frameworks you need a lot of experience to understand whats under the hood and why they want you to do stuff the Angular/React way.
I'm sorry if I was unclear, I want to practice creating simple websites

I've made some in Dreamweaver but I've never used a framework to create anything.

I'm totally new to frameworks so I don't have a clue where to start.
You don't need a framework. You need to start with the basics. Google "web development tutorials". Frameworks aren't some magic word you can throw at a computer and have websites pop out. They come much later, because they're needed for much more complicated projects. For now, you need to solidify your understanding of how websites work, get experience with programming, and HTML/CSS.

If you want to explore backend development, you could look into something like php, but you shouldn't start with a framework. 
What do you think of Dreamweaver? Good or bad? Why?
Bad. Fact of the matter is any practical web development is done by writing code, not dragging around boxes in a visual editor. They produce low quality, unpredictable and unmaintainable code, it's not flexible enough, and won't get you anywhere. Plus once you take the time to learn how html and css works, it's not really gonna save any time either. Beginners like Dreamweaver because they lack sufficient knowledge to do things and they use it as a crutch. The sooner you get rid of it, the better. 

I mean, technically if you just use Dreamweaver as a text editor, there's nothing wrong with that.. Although I don't know of any developer that does that. There's a huge amount of bloat in Dreamweaver intended for the visual editor, so you're better off using something more practical (Sublime Text, Atom, Brackets, PHPstorm)
Yes I looked at LearnCode.academy and he recommended just using a simple notepad program like Sublime text.

I'm gonna keep watching his videos I think, he seems pretty good and explains stuff well and links to things he finds useful.
I write plain code, mainly use Sublime, but sometimes still open Dreamweaver - split panes with live view for some small CSS tweaks, easier manual data entry in tables, and the Apply source formatting is essential when you're hacking away at someone else's unaligned code. 
If I want to I can upload to Ftp with one click too. 

It's not a bad program. It's how you use it. 
You should be using something like browsersync for livereload anyway, that's not dependent on the editor you're using. And Sublime has plugins to handle autoformatting. 

You can do everything that dreamweaver does with a better text editor without all the unnecessary bloat that it comes with. 
I'm also using live reload. I should be using what works best for me.

Sometimes Dreamweaver is easier/faster (I already had Dreamweaver by the way, wouldn't buy it for this, but wouldn't bash it either)
Edit - there is no "apply source formatting" functionality in Sublime by the way. (it fixes indentation universally, no matter what language you write in).
Help make the site mobile friendly by having 2 versions of each movie's image: large and small. 

Right now you have a "max-height: 300px;" on the image, causing it to size down quite a bit on the page. And the current version of the images appear to be about 0.5 MB each. This makes the site look and feel slow, not to mention taking more than 1 second to load on mobile.

A smaller version of the image could probably easily be below 100 KB
Thanks for the feedback. I'll definitely make some smaller image files for mobile. But I think the site might remain this slow because it's actually scrapping the movie data for each page load. I'm planning on implementing a database in the future, but learning some web scraping was my initial focus. 
>What is bootstrap? Bootstrap is the best HTML, CSS and JAVA framework

Nope. No Java here. JavaScript is what you seek. 
Def not "downloading" anything from this site lol.
F to F for responsive on Android. Can't even pinch in to see entire page. Hamburger menu fails too. Interested to read this, but it will have to wait.
I doubt there is any good single tutorial for it. It's too wide of a subject. Really you just have to make websites, and google stuff as you come across problems.

What you can do actively is try to research and study in depth how the `position`, `display` and `float` properties work. 
I reference this a lot even though I've been using CSS for over 5 years
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/
Maybe you could use some reinforcement on some of the fundamentals of CSS (ain't nothing wrong with that). I've found this site very useful myself.

Check it out:
http://www.atozcss.com/
Just play around and fork peoples creations on CodePen and you can teach yourself :)
>The main issue for me is getting elements to go where I want them to go.

look into using a grid system. I've been using bootstrap for a few years now and it's super easy once you get the hang of it.

read this http://www.helloerik.com/the-subtle-magic-behind-why-the-bootstrap-3-grid-works

really helped me wrap my head around the grid and positioning 

I consider "advanced" css (flexbox, transforms, animations) wont really help make things look good on their own. you need to think more as a designer than a developer if you want to make things look good.


Understanding natural document flow is probably the most important thing a frontend dev should know. google around
Personally, I use foundation for front-end. It looks nice and gets the job done. (I'm still in high school so I don't know if this is frowned upon in the real world)
YouTube DevTips. He goes through setting up a personal website and writes his own CSS positioning framework. It's quite in depth as well. 
First I would suggest you start all your projects using the [html5bp template](http://www.initializr.com/), just adding a css reset and starting off with a solid foundation can fix many problems (there is a bootstrap version as well).

Next I would suggest you watch Shay Howe's [Front End Lego's talk](https://vimeo.com/70115794)

I would then suggest you read the Estelle Weyl's [article on specificity](http://www.standardista.com/css3/css-specificity/).  Basically this is your guide to not using Important!

And finally I would suggest locating articles on [css-tricks](https://css-tricks.com/) to tackle specific issues.


Whether it's front end or back end, find website examples and start picking parts you like from each. From layouts, to how type and color is handled all the way to basic transition effects - make a favorites folder for sites that you like.

Then you have a huge reference when you go to create one of these pages not only of visual examples, but you can pick through the source code to re-create the parts you adopt.

Bootstrap all the way! Also, for learning CSS I found a good way was to go onto a website (start simple) in chrome or Firefox and use the developer tools and change things, see what happens! But bootstrap helped me a lot, especially with responsive design! Good luck
Take a look at here: http://technical.nailfashionsweden.se
A person has very limited control in CSS until they have these three properties (and their related properties like clear, z-index etc) under their belt. 

After that, I'd say get into pre-processors and review other's code on codepen or related sites. You can learn a lot by reading what other people are making.
Should I even waste my time learning to create responsive layouts with media queries, percentages and ems or just learn bootstrap? 
Not really, I'd say most companies/devs use either Bootstrap or Foundation.
"Positioning framework"? Do you by any chance mean a grid system?
I'd argue that you can start using pre-processors almost immediately, because either way it's very simple distinguishing what's plain CSS and what's a pre-CSS feature.
I wouldn't call it a waste of time, and bootstrap or other responsive grid systems aren't a 'one size fits all' solution. It really depends on the client/project. 

It's also good to know the underlaying principals behind the frameworks instead of blindly using them.

media queries, percentages, ems and rems are still good to know. 

I'd start with a simple custom responsive layout using media queries, theres tons of tutorials. then once you're comfortable move on up to frameworks
Yeah pretty much, but it's all custom
Awesome, thanks man 
Something something React.
MEAN stack
Material Design is ebbing a little bit

Framework depending on the type of site / content / usage. 

Swift was just opened sourced and hot for a minute. 

Bootstrap is always popular.

I still don't understand people who say they are learning "nodejs".

You mean, like... Javascript? 
Something something Mongo.
React looks amazing, I've never built anything with it but I want to
Thanks for the tip!
To be fair server side code tends to be a lot different from client side code even if it is both javascript, your just doing different things. 
Just learning all the stuff that you're capable of doing with it, I guess
Something something know every single web framework/library on top of having the docs memorized. 
it seems to me like mongo is losing steam
Honestly, I don't even know what it is...
...There are docs?  I thought we were supposed to just read the source to figure out how to use the frameworks and libraries since everything is on github nowadays. 
>Initially i looked into php, however i saw its more of a user input defined framework than a "automatic actions performed by server"(?) kinda framework (is that even correct to say?)

PHP ain't a framework, it's a programming language. And yeah PHP is request based (it gets executed for every HTTP request) and not really intended to be run at regular intervals.

You could really use any programming language. Python is ideal for scripts. So you could write a python script and use [`cron jobs`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron) to run it automatically every 10 minutes.

What do you do with that API data? If you always overwrite it you might not even need a database.
I definitely recommend putting thought in to /u/larivact's suggestion and evaluating whether you really need the DB.  You could always use a flat file (JSON or CSV) if you don't have that large a data set.

I would add to his comment though, that you should try and find something that is closer to what you're comfortable with and maybe not worry about using a full framework.  All you really need for this is cron, an ORM, and a REST client.

Since you've done a lot of front-end/low-level programming, I'm guessing you're comfortable with C/C++?  There are plenty of REST clients and ORM's for C++ that should be able to help you with this.  If you've done any web front-end work, then maybe now is the time to jump in to node.js; you should have no problem finding tons of NPM packages to do this.
I'd recommend looking into Javascript frameworks. Angular, React, Backbone/Marionette etc. and put the time in up front to research and outline what you're aiming to accomplish with the backend and find a couple of good tutorials/starter projects on Github and as you begin to get a handle on the basics, move up to more advanced projects until you're comfortable initializing the stack yourself. Along the way, be sure to play with them, break them, or ditch the resource for another one all together (assuming you're familiar with git or a different vcs). Do that until you have a high level understanding on how your backend framework feeds the front end you're already familiar with and I think you'll be in a good position 
Hmm, in a few comparisons between web frameworks they always mentioned php, so i just assumed...


You can run php scripts from via commands as well though (in facts it's considered a best practice among more purist developers to make all the apps actions executable via commands, then they just call the commands from their controllers(this is overkill in most cases though)).

But Symfonys [console](https://github.com/symfony/console) component is great for this. 
I suspect he actually means high level programming.

All you need is cron, curl, something like Python to write a parser, and a library for the language you choose to write the parser in to interface with the database.  Don't even really need curl, just a HTTP lib for Python.

I agree, no need for a database here.  JSON flat file.
No, i mean low level, just never in this specific area :p

And also,i guess i could use whatever programming language as long as it runs on the server, but i was just assuming there are frameworks built to handle this sort of needs, im just trying to figure them out.

Ive taken a look at python, and the Bottle framework, and it looks lightweight and simple enough, perhaps i should use it.

As for webservers, are they usually just a linux server where i simply ssh to them, install whatever i need, run the scripts and thats it, or do they have control panels from retailers? if they have control panels, how do they interact with python, seeing as python is a general purpose programming language, unlike php.
>but i was just assuming there are frameworks built to handle this sort of needs, im just trying to figure them out.

You haven't really told us what you are trying to achieve. But frameworks are meant for bigger more complex applications. If you just want to regularly request some APIs and store the results you could do this in a 50 line python script. It seems like what you need are libraries not frameworks. Check out the [Requests python lib](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/).

>As for webservers, are they usually just a linux server where i simply ssh to them, install whatever i need, run the scripts and thats it, or do they have control panels from retailers?

A web server is just a program that runs on a server. You are talking about web hosts. It depends. Some allow full SSH access others only let you ftp into the www directory others have some web control panel. I would prefer SSH because you have full control.
I asked for a framework because from my googling i got the idea that when not using php, you need to create your own routing(is that the word) to the specific page youre trying to present. I guess i could do that on my own, i just got the impression that there are  frameworks that cut that part for me, as thats not really what i want to focus on.

I took a look at the lib you linked, it seems exactly what im looking for to get the information i need, thanks!

As for the presentation for said information, do you have any suggestions? should i just keep using python(bottle,flask,etc), seeing as im going to write the script in python, or are there better alternatives for simply displaying information from a constantly changing file on a static webpage (kinda contradicts itself, but i hope you get what i mean. Still havnt got the terminology right).

If you have a web server with only ftp access, how are you supposed to run the necessary scripts if the website is not made with php?
You could combine python and PHP. So you would have your python script that fetches the data and stores it in a .json file (every 10 mins via cron) and the PHP code would read the file and display it.

>If you have a web server with only ftp access, how are you supposed to run the necessary scripts if the website is not made with php?

You can't.
You could start contributing fixes to Umbraco (.Net CMS, if you weren't familiar). There are plenty of bugs on the issue tracker, the community would appreciate it, and yeah, it's a good piece of gear to work with. 
I forgot about this! Hope mine. One soon. Forgot what I picked heh
i remember them, but i hope they didn't forget me :)

People, like me, have personal weather stations that they can sync with them to view the live and archived data.
http://forecast.io/ has a free API iirc (with rate limiting).
Looking at the code of jquery.simpleWeather.js shows they use the Yahoo API.
Why not just use the NOAA api? That is the same data all weather services use for their forecasts
I've done a bit of weather info parsing in the past. (I'm assuming you're in the US) I always got weather information from http://weather.gov, http://noaa.gov, http://aviationweather.gov In general, a lot of data is available, but will require some reformatting, digestion, etc. Also, when I did it (2 years ago), navigating NOAA was a nightmare, due to dead services, bad UI/lack of information about their services.


Hope this helps!

I used it in my app and I like the results! It was pretty easy to work with too.
That's impressive.
That's what I did with a Vantage 2 Pro.  Realized it has a pin header in the battery area, did some Googling and found it it pushed out data over a pin, connected it to a RPi, wrote a Python application to communicate over serial, etc.

https://github.com/vesrah/bit-bucket/blob/master/projects/piweather/

This is old and terrible code.
There is no one perfect method, the most import think imho is simply to keep at it.

Set aside sometime every day (20 mins to an hour) and during that time either learn something new or work on your project. You won't have to consciously "stay fresh" with your current knowledge because it will be used over and over again while you are learning the new stuff. 

It sounds like you are on the right track here, just keep doing what you're doing. 
Always push to include the new framework or tech in your next project. This is THE BEST way I've come across to make myself learn and have the time for it. Of course, be very cautious about the limitations and applications of the new tech and see if it suits your project or not. 
Have a personal project(s) that you are passionate about. Find a favorite tech related news source (my favorites are ArsTechinica and Y Combinator's HackerNews). Whenever you read about a new open source project that interests you or a framework that seems to be getting some attention, try to implement small features in your project(s) that utilize them. 

Not sure if this makes sense, but this has been my way of keeping of with the industry over the years. 
1. Add Hacker News repost sub to your list of fav subreddits. 
2. Make Hacker News page on Facebook appear on top of your newsfeed
3. Build a product on the side. 

The secret is to make Hacker News follow you everywhere. 
No disrespect, but this is a terrible idea if you have to support these applications for any amount of time. Imagine creating 10 apps all with different languages and frameworks. Now fast forward 6 months and you need to make an enhancement it major bug fix on a few of them. You will be completely lost and it will take you a long time to re-figure out  out what you were doing. All of the knowledge you have built up over the last few months will be pretty much worthless because you were chasing the new shiny. If you are just looking to build your resume, or don't give a shit what happens after you deploy, then yes, follow the new shiny. 

In reality, you should be selective with what new technologies you push to production because you might be living with them for a lot longer then you think. 

If you want to work on new things, try it out on personal projects or one-off quick apps/scripts. Especially if you are doing work for clients, I think it is not responsible for you to charge for something you basically have no experience with and will be a "learning" project for you. 
I think a new framework for each project is pushing it too far. You should absolutely try different frameworks and technologies but you need to learn a select few really well, not a little bit of all of them. 
Be very selective, yes.  However, if you decide to stick with what you know you're going to be that guy that is still writing CakePHP sites.  We move forward incrementally with each new project and some of that time is written off by the company for training/career development.  No one wants to work at that place that is stuck in the past.

Don't be the FoM guy that we all know, but also don't be that guy that is married to ASP.NET Webforms and the Microsoft stack.
I accept your perspective to it. I haven't had a problem with this approach but I see your point. True especially for web development because frameworks and libraries evolve so fast. 
I agree with all of this except the last sentence. I have no problem charging for learning. I consider being able to learn these things quickly my primary skill. Of course there has to be a reason for me to learn something I wouldn't just do it to do it.

But i'm at the point where I never rule myself out of anything due to the technology used. If I have to learn something I learn it. I've never made an android app before, but if someone wanted to pay me to make one I wouldn't hesitate.
This is my mindset right now. I just started getting used to SASS, particularly using bourbon and bitters as import libraries, and learning how to import other sass files. On top of learning SASS, my main goal is to get super good at HTML/CSS(SASS) and JS, period.

Yeah I know some jQuery, but I've learned my lesson in the past, and being a jack of all trades is nothing compared to the master of something.


> Don't be the FoM guy that we all know, but also don't be that guy that is married to ASP.NET Webforms and the Microsoft stack.


Oh my god. I look at those "senior" decision making people who have slow rate of adoption and my biggest wish in life is to not become that guy as I progress in my career. 
Absolutely right
Honestly, I let HN do most of the work. Though it's primarily tired startup crap, it has a pretty eclectic variety and I think it's a good pulse for what is happening with the software world. My reader is already filled to the brim with other news/hobby sources so I couldn't care less about finding dev blogs to follow because I liked one of their articles this one time.

Then again, I always kept tabs on [codinghorror](https://blog.codinghorror.com/), even before I got into programming. The guy knows how to craft a post and keep readers engaged (he even did a post about how exactly to keep readers engaged with your typical blog post.)
http://www.webdesignrepo.com/ Here is the list of many popular blogs, resources, tutorials, etc.
http://www.smashingmagazine.com/ is my goto for up-to-date best practices
I think the keeping up to date with specific blogs is the wrong way to go. There are very few blogs that manage to maintain their frequency and quality at the same time. What I've found better than reddit or HackerNews is the "<programming language> Weekly" newsletters. They seem to do a better job of aggregating programming language specific posts from around the Internet. Here are some examples:

[Python Weekly](http://www.pythonweekly.com/)

[Ruby Weekly](http://rubyweekly.com/)

[Go Lang Weekly](http://golangweekly.com/)

[Javascript Weekly](http://javascriptweekly.com/)

[Node Weekly](http://nodeweekly.com/)

[Web Operations Weekly](http://webopsweekly.com/)

[DB Weekly](http://dbweekly.com/)

[Morning Brew](http://themorningbrew.net/) (daily .NET newsletter)

Obviously there's some overlap between some of these (it's probably not necessary to have Javascript weekly and Node weekly) so sometimes I unsubscribe from some of them.
http://webplatformdaily.org/
[scotch.io](http://www.scotch.io)
This is more .NET focused, but Chris keeps a great daily aggregate of web development resources. [The Morning Brew](http://themorningbrew.net)
I was on a *long* hiatus with this, but I've recently returned to posting on [TheWeb.Today](http://theweb.today). 

In each post, its just a link to 10-15 articles (or sometimes conference talk videos) which I think are high-quality and are worth reading/watching. Just the links and nothing else. No extra fluff. 

I'll make a new post every few weeks, so I would suggest you subscribe to the newsletter so you know whenever there is a new one.  I hope to regularly keep it updated this year. 
Not blogs but good sources to keep updated:

https://gist.github.com/DrummerHead/bb62741ecf65a4e601a3
[The changelog podcasts](https://changelog.com/podcast/)
Pluralsight has two blogs that are worthwhile to follow. 

1. [Tutorials](http://tutorials.pluralsight.com)
1. [Blog](http://blog.pluralsight.com)

The tutorials site is new, and is slowly building up steam.
Not a blog/website per se but a really nice podcast I have been listening to pretty heavily. https://devchat.tv/js-jabber/ I use it mostly for introductions to different frameworks and apps out there for integration. Some of the in depth interviews with creators of a particular framework are awesome.
I write about topics to help JavaScript developers take their skills to the next level here: http://codeutopia.net/

Recent topics include how to fix bugs faster, unit testing, ES6, etc., and I also have a newsletter where I post more stuff which you can subscribe to if you like the content on the site
HN and the Safari Books subscription.  I know Safari isn't a blog, but I use it to see what the 'hotness'es are too.
I haven't used an RSS feed reader in a while. I used to also follow Dare Obasanjo's 26 Hours a Day blog (or whatever it was called) and O'Reilly used to have a few good blogs but quite frankly I'm all blogged out right now. 

It's times like this that I feel like changing profession from IT to farming.

What is HN?
Nice shill for HN.
Haha always weird to see my own site on Reddit. Thanks for posting!
gotos are bad mmmkay
Went there on my phone. What a mistake. I'm sure he probably has a great blog but maybe not for design 
Hacker news.

http://news.ycombinator.com
https://news.ycombinator.com/
I don't think hacker news wants more members because they go with the theory the more people you have the worse it gets. 
Ask me what I think about the community, and you won't think that.
Maybe it's just me but when I opened https://rrrepo.co/repo/webdesign it took a bit to load all the info. I initially thought it didn't have anything.
Thanks a lot!
I smell another shill.
rrrepo is pretty horrible right now, so it's not you. Loading, UX and basically everything else is piss poor. I dropped the ball with rrrepo, sorry guys! I will be rebuilding it from scratch though in the near future :)
Be careful with HN.  It is mostly hyperbole.  Its basically BuzzFeed for techies.  Take it with a grain of salt, you will be a lot of people posting links along the lines of "Why your rails stack is shit and how I figured out how tech stacks are going to work in 2050".
Definitely. 
I finally finished converting to an OCaml stack like everyone there said I should ... Do I need to change again?!
Cool effect man! Using the reddit app on mobile so couldn't look at the code, is it pure css? Or did you have to use some js too?
Its pure CSS, no JS at all. I tried to make it just one DOM node however I had to resort to using two.
Just a note: I am in no way affiliated with Unify. And do not profit from this post at all.

Pick a language you think is interesting and do all the courses for it. 

Invest as much time as you can spare. 
YouTube is a great free resource to learn the basics. And as a developer, I invest minimum  8 hours a day 5-7 days a week (as a working professional) when I'm not working I am reading or working on my own projects. 

I spend a lot of my spare time developing, because its something I love to do.
There are a bunch of resources in the sidebar. In general, this is a really useful sub when you are learning, but you should post about specific questions when you have them.
This might interest you, https://weworkremotely.com
You might want to try upwork.com, I know a lot of people who get webdev projects there. 
I even got my current job (remote) from a client there.
Of course. Have you tried? 

First step - sign up to UpWork and start applying for some jobs on there. You're competing with the rest of the world, so have a good portfolio and don't make spam applications.

Do a good job, and you might build a client relationship that will last.

Good luck.
Isn't Upwork the worst place to freelance though? All I hear are complaints from the people that have worked there saying "Don't use Upwork!"

Thanks very much! I'll try my luck!
I signed up for this after seeing you mention it.

How lenient should I be with my pricing per hour?
It's only a shit place to use if you try to price compete with the third world. Don't! Be worth more, and charge more. There's plenty of people on UpWork charging $50+/hour.
That's really hard to answer. If you've just signed up you don't have any logged work on oDesk and will have to work a bit harder to get your first job. I'd say pick a rate you're comfortable with and for your first job or two be willing to drop the rate a bit.
Good to hear! Any idea what kind of web dev jobs are most in demand? Just browsing Upwork briefly, it seems like a lot of small Wordpress gigs and not a lot of JavaScript/React/Node.

When we talk about page weight, we're talking about performance, and the most important fact you need to remember about performance is this: We humans are notoriously bad at estimating what code will be faster or smaller, or where the bottlenecks will be. All too often we rely solely on **assumptions**, but our assumptions are frequently faulty. Optimization must be preceded by measurement. Fortunately others have [measured](https://developer.yahoo.com/performance/rules.html) for us, and page weight isn't nearly as important as we **assumed**. If you want to make your site faster, then **stop obsessing over page weight**. Instead, make fewer HTTP requests. Use a CDN. Leverage browser cache. These are the things that measurement has proven matter the most.
That article was about a lot more than just bloated pages and long load times. It was pretty interesting. As to his point at the very end, I don't think we can ever go back. I think the passive consumerist overly complicated surveillance web that funnels money and knowledge only one way is only going to get worse. The good old days are over.
While I get his point, there's a reason all the websites are doing this. User engagement and money.

Nobody really cares about design, good design doesn't pay bills. 'Good' design might not even be the best choice for promoting user engagement. People go to website to look at stuff, like read tech news, nobody sits and admire design (unfortunately).

I just feel like, as the author said, we're in the middle of a bubble. Everyone is trying to get a piece of the pie. Why on earth would anyone need more than 1 tech news website? Why are there 30000 of them? It's a race to rock bottom and websites that can keep working while getting the minimum amount of profit will win by simply outlasting the rest. But the problem is, we're adding dozens, if not hundreds of millions of new internet users every year. So, there's more and more pie for everyone and no reason to stop and think about things like design.
This is the best tl;dr I could make, [original](http://idlewords.com/talks/website_obesity.htm) reduced by 99%. (I'm a bot)

I think what's important to note here is the content to code ratio. There's a lot to take in here.

(sees layout made with td and tr tags) 

All right, he still needs improvement in the code department.
If you read the whole thing you'll see he he's also talking about ad bloat, design strategy ("chickenshit minimalism"), content strategy, and ux. He also mentions many of the tools linked in your reference, like CDN's... what makes this a great read is that it's about a lot more than simply complaining about gross page weight. 
If we're going to examine every detail in the article, then let's not cherry pick only the good stuff. The author also says things like this:

> In conversations with web performance advocates, I sometimes feel like a hippie talking to SUV owners about fuel economy.
They have all kinds of weirdly specific tricks to improve mileage. Deflate the front left tire a little bit. Put a magnet on the gas cap. Fold in the side mirrors.
Most of the talk about web performance is similarly technical, involving compression, asynchronous loading, sequencing assets, batching HTTP requests, pipelining, and minification.
All of it obscures a simpler solution.

Minimizing HTTP requests has been shown repeatedly through measurement to be the most important factor in page performance, yet the author seems to shrug it off as a "weirdly specific trick." The author, it seems, would have you ignore the things that matter the most and obsess over the things that matter a whole lot less.

The article is long enough that, yes, I'm sure you can find nuggets here and there that are genuinely correct. He even digresses into "surveillance" and "liberty" on occasion. But what seems to be the main point of the whole piece, the "obesity crisis," is largely wrong.
Minimizing requests isn't a magic bullet unless you're already conscious of size from the get-go -- he is advocating size-conscious decision making throughout the whole design process. I don't think your points and his are mutually exclusive. 
^ Yup you are right, he actually says that right if a site can be made in 1 MB, it is first made in 10 MB than people try to reduce it down using magic tricks. Why not make it fast from the start?

For me the best part of the article was:
>I want to share with you my simple two-step secret to improving the performance of any website.
>Make sure that the most important elements of the page download and render first.
>
>Stop there.

>You don't need all that other crap. Have courage in your minimalism.
There's nothing better than two different recruiters contacting you to swear they solely represent the same candidate, then having one of those same recruiters contact you at work to offer you that job at your own workplace.

I've said this before, this is a serious, serious over supply over developers, for a definition of "developer" that is "likes to install Wordpress themes". Anything else seems to be a different story.
A few years ago the company I was working for at the time was looking for my replacement (I resigned) and I was part of the hiring process.

Let me tell you we got a lot of applications, but I would say only 3-4 out of a total of 25-30 applications were actually worth a good look and probably only 1-2 an interview.

It is really difficult to find good, solid developers.
There is not a lack of developers. There is a lack of developers that are professional, know how to write proper emails and documentation, interface with the client, and follow established patterns. That's why those jobs are always open.
I'm involved in a lot of the recruitment at my work - we choose to be very picky and can afford to keep looking for several months, rather than rushing to fill a gap with someone who might not necessarily be best for the role.

As has been mentioned in the other answers, good developers aren't usually looking for jobs, because they're already happily working somewhere. So yes, you do have to sift through a lot of noise, but it's also not just a case of finding a technically capable developer but one who is also going to fit in with the team, will understand our culture and enjoy the nature of our work. Plus, they need to be in the same physical location, so it's a fairly specific area of the Venn diagram that needs targeted. The way we see it though is that it's better to have all that pain up front rather than having to let someone go before the end of their probation, or vice versa them leave, and to be back to square one a few months later. 
> I am curious to know what the demand for these jobs are. 

Probably high demand. In busier areas it's always high demand.

> I see some companies that keep posting the same job month after month and nothing seems to be changing.

Been there, done that. 99 Out of 100 applicants: trash. Just trash. Most have a job application requirement to receive government support (in the Netherlands), others are hardly qualified ("I'm 56 and I made a Wordpress site in 1982, I qualify as a React developer"), others even less than that. And the remaining 20 are people from India.

> Is there a serious lack of developers?

Nah, only good ones.

> How many applications do you get per job posting? 

First week: about 100. Then another 20 per week after, indefinitely.

> What quality are the developers?

None to low. The occasional good one that gets invited to an interview... once every 300 on average, I think. Of those, 1 in 10 gets hired.

> If you are going to go into detail about the developers, could you give an example of how good or bad their portfolio is.

Portfolio? That's a dream come true!

1. 50%: crapfolio;
2. 50%: no portfolio.

The best developers that are available tend to not have a very good portfolio. They don't have time to make a portfolio. Some might have a github account with valuable content on it. Most don't; most worked on closed source projects all their careers and don't have/take the time to work open-source projects at night.

I don't look at portfolios. I don't ask for it. If you have the required skillset, are somewhat nearby, interesting and proven job experience, you'll get an interview in which I'll test:

1. Your personality and communication skills and general sense of how truthful you were on your resume;
2. Basic skills test.

The rest we'll see in your trial period (lawful 1 month period in which we can fire you for no reason at all, and also you could never show up and quit for no reason at all). 
For every senior position web application developer posting if we are lucky we may get 25-40 applicants. HR ~~widows~~ winnows out the chaff and we may see at most 10 or so resumes. Of those ten we may choose to interview around 5. Then usually each of those five *senior* applicants utterly fail to accomplish [FizzBuzz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz). Lather rinse repeat. 

In my approximately four years at the job we've hired one professional. That said all of our paid student interns have been awesome. Some maybe even out performed the *senior* level candidates. 

**tl;dr;** Lots of applicants, few good ones; but it's OK we make the interns do all the work
> Is there a serious lack of developers?

Yes and no. There really isn't a yard stick or accepted standard for when you're a developer. You study, and try to get hired, so many/most developers -and even employers- rely on self evaluation. The Dunning-Kruger effect runs rampant. There are a lot of "developers", there are only a handful who thrive in a business environment. 

> How many applications do you get per job posting? 

Depends on the post, depends on the company, the location(city size) and their resources, etc. etc. Anywhere from 20 to 80 resumes or considerably more per job post.

> What quality are the developers? 

Shit, generally. It's not just about development quality, however. Human attributes like reliability, sociability, resilience under pressure and other factors end up easily being just as important. I'd much rather hire someone who has some learning to do with all the human attributes in place than someone who arrives with knowledge who's a complete pissant to work with. It doesn't matter what you're capable of, if nothing gets done.

> could you give an example of how good or bad their portfolio is.

I'm not sure how common my sentiment is, but I've come to a lot of realizations over time which have modified my viewpoint in regard to sifting through the rubbish. 

First, the best developers don't necessarily have the best portfolio. Although I see the mentality posted in other job postings: "Must have online portfolio." And the employers, knowing nothing about what to look for other than "wow", just invite the one with the best looking landing page.

The problem is, developers who are in demand are churning out work *for clients*, not for themselves. In many cases, there's a direct correlation between fancy portfolio and lack of real-world experience. A client list sent in a word document can be *way* more valuable than a link to an aesthetically pleasing showcase. Your portfolio shows me what it looks like when you work by yourself, your clients show me what you produce in the messy world of collaboration; the difference in challenge between the two is substantial.

Second, I'm opposed to code testing or custom work samples.  I even go as far as discouraging people who are looking for work to entertain such requests for potential employers; it's a giant red flag. 

If I want to see code samples, or examine your understanding of syntax and structure, I'll ask you to bring in your favorite work and walk me through it. The same goes for design. I really don't care what they have to google, because developer quality isn't measured by how many functions they have memorized. I want to know how your mind works. I want to know the challenges you've encountered and how it was ultimately solved. 

From an employee perspective, I would want to get hired by someone who took the same approach. When someone takes the time to understand you before hiring, they're probably going to take the same approach post hiring. When they want free work in exchange for a *chance* at getting hired, there's a good possibility they're incapable of examining your current talent, and don't value your time. 

My company paid to post on LinkedIn. We got contacted by 2 recruiters and a guy who worked at wal mart in the month we had it up. There is no such thing as an unemployed developer in my area. 
I'm working my first job remotely and I had a small conversation with my lead about why hiring for our current project is such an issue. It boils down to how difficult it is to find people who are skilled, let alone people who are honest about what they are capable of. He said it was great for me to be intellectually honest, so he knew what tasks I was capable of.
There are tons of developers looking for jobs. There are very few that are good developers and worth being hired. 
Not above the junior level, no. We are a large digital ad agency and have a hard time finding qualified front end developers at the senior and higher level. It's not hard to find people with some HTML, CSS, Javascript experience that can knock out landing pages. Much harder to find experienced people that can deal with more complex situations.
It's like everything else in the world: 80% of it is shit.

 We're near NYC, and most of the applicants are General Assembly greenhorns who majored in <insert random liberal arts major>, the last people we want (not disparaging the program, they just don't teach the kind of grounding we look for). Sometimes people are *boring*, and flub the phone interview with a wet fart of a personality. Sometimes when walking through a project of theirs/tackling a simple SPA assignment, they don't know as much as they say they do. And even then when preparing an offer, sometimes they take another offer at the last minute or turn out to be huge dicks.
[deleted]
100% agree. We received a bajillion applicants at my last job where we worked with recruiting agencies. However, the vast majority of them could only do light copy paste work with Wordpress and/or jQuery. There may be a ton of devs out there, but there's a huge shortage in quality ones. 
By install wordpress themes do you mean create from scratch?
Can you elaborate on what set those developers apart from the others?
Indeed. A huge part of the job is great communication. If you want to get into web/software development because "you don't like to deal with people" you might be in for a rude awakening. 
This. A million times this.
Exactly. There are plenty of neck beards in this industry, but a real key in getting ahead is being someone people WANT to work with.

You must know the technology, but you also need to know how to be a part of a team.

This is true. My portfolio has gone to shit since I got a job. And it is pretty rare i'm allowed to put something I do for work in my portfolio (by rare I mean never). 

I have kind of turned to blogging as a way to show my knowledge. Its also just a hobby for me. 

"widows out the ..."?
Is that some butchered/custom version of "whittles down the ..."?

edit: after looking around it seems maybe you meant "winnows" and it may have been an autocorrect issue.
> guy who worked at wal mart

Whatever your current job is does not mean you don't have the potential for something more.


 
And which area would that be?
I'm currently available for 20 hours per week if your lead would like to talk.  Front-end developer with Node experience, CS degree, eye for design.  Strong JS/programming knowledge. Solid CSS skills and workflow.  Can PM my Github and more information on myself and my work experience/open source contributions.  Based in EST timezone.

EDIT: Not really sure why I'm being downvoted.  This person is talking about how his current project is short on developers and specifically mentions it's a remote gig. Plus, this whole thread is centered around people talking about how they can't find good developers. Why is it a problem that I mention that I'm available for work?  Sorry for networking? 

\*_Upvotes post where people are complaining about a problem.  Downvotes comment where person offers solution._\*
Because most jobs people hire for are solving unique problems that no one has solved before and changing the world, and so can't be handled by anyone but a 10x rockstar developer.

Right?
I'm a little worried about people assuming I'm a hack and throwing my resume in the trash. I'm pretty new to all this. My degree is in lit studies and I only have a handful of smaller-scale professional projects. I've been very careful to learn things 'the right way' and not brush off topics like compilers, algorithms, oop, unit testing, design patterns, etc.  More recently, I've been very focused on .NET/C# in the hopes that it'll help paint me in the right light (also because C# is awesome). 

I think people know that once I talk with them, but it's difficult to  position myself on paper. I don't know how to express that on my resume. Any thoughts?
My only question if I were to see a CV with this much on it is "How good actually are you at any of this?" I only say this because it's quite often the case that developers listing mass amounts of what are honestly just buzzwords are usually just a [Jack of All Trades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_of_all_trades,_master_of_none). While I'm sure you're more than adequate at all of this, keep in mind that some might see it as over compensating. Smaller companies may also get the impression that you'll be expensive and unlikely to stick around for too long. 

Of course this is just my 2 cents, you're obviously smart and worth a good pay packet. In the UK I'd estimate Â£30k+ depending on the location (London could over Â£40k)
If you can prove half of everything you just said, there isn't anywhere you can't work, and comfortably.
Why would you want to get some work in the USA?

There are tonnes of possibilities in the EU, and most of them pay better than you would get as an 'outsourced' resource in a USA company.
With a skill-set like that, why not just get a great job in the EU? 

Employers should be falling over themselves to get you, unless there's a) there's something very wrong with you as a person or b) you live somewhere very unfortunate.

You'd be getting an easy 100k+ here.

Try apply to some remote jobs in the US if you want ... I think you will get easy interviews.
No role in a corporate setting will be looking for that broad of a skill set. Honestly most of those concepts are something a fresh computer engineering college grad should know. 

I see skills that can make you a network engineer, web developer, or hardware engineer. Each of these roles has different pay at different expertise levels in different areas of the US. College grads tend to start at 60k on the low end or can go as high as 90k+. 
Buzzwording bit, eh?
wtf... wow
What do you mean copy and paste work with wordpress?
He means throwing a WYSIWYG framework up and filling the site in.
I mean "buys from Themeforest and installs".
Just plain skill. Some of the portfolios we saw were just terrible. We were looking for a semi-senior front end dev and we saw a lot of portfolios with crappy Joomla sites, badly coded Wordpress templates, etc. 

Some of them would be more suited for a junior position, some of them were just lagging behind in terms of tech used (with no indication they were learning or up to date on newer tech).
Passion. The biggest factor outside of a culture fit. A good developer is passionate about what he does and will learn anything that will make him a better developer.
Hmm... yes, autocorrect. Of course, it was autocorrect, and totally not my fault at all.
I don't disagree, but this was for a senior front end developer. So we were looking for someone with more than zero experience. That said, I don't fault the person who applied. Just noting how the post didn't return useful applications. 
Everywhere.

If you're unemployed it is because you are absolutely terrible, have unrealistic expectations, or choose to be.
SLC
cringe
Of course not. Junior developers are plentiful. 
When he mentions the liberal arts major, I think he is indicating more that the applicants lack a foundation in CS, which you seem to be pursuing.

My experience has been that writing a strong cover letter is far more important than a resume.  It gives you a chance to express who you are, what you've done, what you're doing, your strengths, etc.  Instead of just having ".NET/C#", you can express that you love C# and let them know exactly how much experience you have under your belt.  After introducing yourself and explaining what you want, you can include a little section like this:

"A little about myself:

My education is in Literature Studies, but I have decided to pursue a career in software development.  Despite my background, I have taken the time to build a solid foundational knowledge in CS.  I love C# and work primarily with .NET/C#.  I have worked on a handful of smaller-scale professional projects.  These include:

- Project 1 (Link to it)

- Project 2

I have also worked on a personal project (or projects), which are available on my Github (http://github.com/you).  Some highlights include:

- You get the picture


"

Something along those lines makes for a very strong cover letter.  Also, personal projects and open source contributions are golden when trying to set yourself apart.  Good luck!

Dropping jQuery libs into pages, copy/paste from Stackoverflow, etc.
I mean the devs who only know light Wordpress development and use jQuery and jQuery plugins for everything, while also scouring Stack Overflow and copy pasting solutions they don't understand. It creates more problems then it solves when you don't understand the code your adding to or changing in a project. 
Oh so not copy and past wordpress functions?
Oh yeah... I far exceed that one.
Not sure why you were downvoted, but I fully agree. There's a big difference between a passionate dev and one who isn't. The speed they pick up things, the knowledge they seek, the respect they have for other devs. It all comes back to how passionate they are about development. 

*Edit:* At the time, he had -2 votes. I see the hive has shifted their opinion since. 
Not everywhere, but probably every major or at least medium sized city
Okay, I'm embarrassed to say this but I live in a major Midwest city and I have been unemployed since November of 2014 and unable to get a job offer since then. Also, I am not a completely new developer. I have started this career in 2008. I feel like I'm mostly shit at the interviewing process because my resume has gotten me many interviews.
Would appreciate hearing why you think this cringeworthy.  This whole thread is centered around people talking about how they can't find good developers.
If he lived there, sure. Generally when companies open themselves up to hiring international roles they either 1) do it because they can pay less than local talent or 2) have an international presence already and pay according to local rates anyway. There tends to be a lot more overhead for a company when hiring outside of the country (hell even outside of their operating state), so the likelihood of getting the same rate as your local talent is much lower. 
It isn't great but when you consider free healthcare and a better somewhat better degree of job security it's not all bad. Plus the hassle of obtaining a US visa and the cost of emigrating. While I'd personally love to live in the US, It's far easier and profitable enough to stay within Europe.
Working with wordpress, even if you can do more. That's usually the brunt of what wordpress work comes down too
Oh, no I can create jquery from scratch. wordpress I can only do so much.
You kinda have to copy and paste wordpress functions considering how verbose their apis are. Even adding simple post types involves huge mostly redundant arrays.... God forbid you have to add a custom field(without ACF)... 
It's strange that you use 'hive', because the passion mindset where supposedly passion can take you further than any one without it in any career is way too prevalent. I feel it's a bit unhealthy to think passion alone will set you a part from others, instead of being more objective in saying those who at least enjoy the work and value staying relevant in their careers will invest the extra time.

It's strange for people to see the extra work I do in research and projects call me passionate. I'd always dismiss it and say "I just enjoy working on interesting problems." Now that could be considered 'passion', but it's way too strong a word for me. The same applies to good developers; much fewer people are truly deserving of being called passionate.

This [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/3j9a3p/im_a_developer_but_its_not_my_passion/) embodies my sentiment well.
Can't really cite geography as an excuse here. Tons of development positions are being outsourced. A lot of people I know work remotely anyway. 
Well you know what to work on now. If you are getting interviews then there is an obvious disconnect during the interview that you need to pinpoint and correct.
Yeah this makes me feel better about not knowing everything about wordpress lol.
If you're putting in extra work and love what you do, I'd consider that being passionate about your work. You don't have to be completely infatuated with developing on the job but it can definitely set you apart from others who are just programming to make a living. 
I think this is just a matter of semantics and difference of opinion. What you're describing is what I consider "passion". 
Yup. If you can't get work as a dev it isn't because you don't live in a big city.
https://education.github.com/pack gives you $50 free DO
With phpMyAdmin, I have it installed on my PC. Then I don't need to install it on servers, I just need to add the MySQL login details to my config file. This way, there's less security issues to worry about and you don't need PHP installed on the server (assuming your application isn't php).
For local testing, I suggest a LAMP stack using Virtualbox and Vagrant. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zw2WO2npBU8) goes through the setup on Windows. You can use the scripts referenced in the video, or you can use something like [PuPHPet](https://puphpet.com/) to generate your own. Your website's URL will be http://localhost/folder during dev, unless you configure the hosts on your computer, then you can customize it like mydomain.dev or mydomain.loc. Still, you're the only person that can see it and those domains aren't real.

When it's time to upload to a webhost and have your real domain point to it, probably the easiest way is to use a shared host like Dreamhost and just FTP or [Git Push](https://github.com/pigeontech/gitweb) the files there. Most shared hosts will have phpMyAdmin, and I know Dreamhost has Git installed and allows SSH . They're around $10 a month and you can have as many domains as you want on the same account, it just treats them as separate root folders.

If your site starts getting tons of traffic, it might be time to go for a more pro option like Amazon AWS. Get practice with tweaking your local LAMP stack and moving from the shared host will be mostly straight forward.
Use cheap hosting coupled with a free cloudflair account. They handle the bandwidth and make you pretty much invulnerable to most website attacks.

https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-secure-phpmyadmin-on-ubuntu-14-04

You'll be doing yourself a favour by using a mysql client rather than phpmyadmin instead.

> make you pretty much invulnerable to most website attacks.

Cloudflare has a lot of advantages but if your security strategy is "use cloudflare" you're going to get owned fast.

Hm! OP here. What do you recommend? Or is that too long to summarize? 
I think in general, stating "use X to be invulnerable", for any value of X, is going to be a failed security project.

I'd start with this:

> access to the "phpMyAdmin" feature 

phpmyadmin has been hacked again and again. I'd strongly urge you to consider /u/keythkatz's advice, and learn to SSH to your server and use the proper command line tool.

From there, it's really down to what your site is built in. I'm guessing PHP, in which case, I'd suggest looking into general PHP advice. If MySQL_query() appears anywhere in your code you're probably in for a bad time.

"Use of X will make your site vulnerable" Isn't always true either.  For example if you install phpmyadmin to it's own domain then only host that on an intranet facing IP address it poses a much smaller risk.  The command line is something everyone should be familiar with but presenting complex data relationships on large amounts of data in an easily comprehensible fashion isn't exactly what it is best at.
To get Instapaper-like functionality, why not remove and add classes instead of trying to change the properties of the style sheet? Ie. On click remove class ".serif-text" and add class ".sans-serif-text", remove ".text-lg" add ".text-med". Things are less likely to break that way and would probably be more cross platform friendly, and it's easier for you to maintain if you need to update your design later on. 
You want a rich text editor?
I use a bookmarklet. Saves me so much time refreshing:

    javascript:void(function(){var i,a,s;a=document.getElementsByTagName('link');for(i=0;i<a.length;i++){s=a[i];if(s.rel.toLowerCase().indexOf('stylesheet')>=0&&s.href) {var h=s.href.replace(/(&|%5C?)forceReload=\d+/,'');s.href=h+(h.indexOf('?')>=0?'&':'?')+'forceReload='+(new Date().valueOf())}}})();

EDIT: This just reloads all the CSS on the page without having to reload the page itself. Not sure if you were asking about that or something that live updates as you type in your text editor. If the latter, then you could checkout [Emmet LiveStyle](http://livestyle.io/)
Browsersync is what you are looking for. Injects css,  refreshes on js / HTML  updates. Syncs states between browsers for easier testing in multiple browsers / mobile 
This is the answer you want. Just have functions that add and remove classes and you can set elements to trigger those functions onClick.

See if you can get a junior position somewhere and start working.  The most important thing is to start making things, and if you can convince someone to pay you to do so, do that.

If you can't, then just build websites (get Github and learn git too, since having a lot of projects on Github looks good as long as they're decent) and do projects.

You won't know all the ins and outs of web development until you start doing it professionally, so just make sure your portfolio looks good enough to get a job and use that to learn all you can.  You COULD try freelancing to make money while gaining skills, but I would recommend working for a company first to learn from other, more skilled developers who can help you grow as a dev.
Try applying for junior jobs, I was in the same position and got a job (UK). Just make sure you have side projects relevant to what role you want to do. So if that is front end do some projects that look good, some projects that show functionality ([APIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_open_APIs)) and if you can do both even better.

Make sure you have a GitHub account and know the basics. Also put your side projects on there.

I don't think you will get accepted to Toptal as they are hard to get in, they say "Hire the top 3% of freelance talent". 

Also the lower end freelance websites (freelancer and upwork) are a waste of time for people in developed countries. You spend so much time looking and applying for jobs you could do something else. 

Also if you know any businesses that need a website doing, that would look nice on a resume especially if it is paid.
Maybe you could specialize in an area that other developers find tiresome. I've been struggling with the FedEx web service APIs. Their documentation for each web service tends to be over 700 pages. The demo code is good for learning how to make a basic request but it gets complicated once you start exploring all the options. It is way too much for a full time developer to get into. A business that really needs to finesse their shipping rules should hire a specialist contractor to work with this API.

This is precisely the sort of real world project you should be looking for. FedEx and USPS recently implemented dimensional weight shipping and now thousands of web applications must be modified to save a business money on how they ship products, or at least how they calculate the shipping charges. 

Various payment options also create a lot of work. Recent changes in the SSL protocols that will be accepted has also created a lot of work since some web applications were broken by these changes. 

In other words, there is a lot of work out there if you know what to look for and what skills you should have to meet the needs of online businesses.  
Thanks! I would say my major problem thus far has been building things. I definitely have some ideas. I need to drum up a bit of a portfolio over the next few months, then I'll start applying. 

I also have all of the tutorials I've completed, but I would feel bad putting those on my portfolio since they are not my own, but I wonder if they would add any value whatsoever as long as I make it clear that they are completed tutorials/course work? 
I am in almost same situation as op though I have an associate in applied science but same knowledge of programming. Applying for a job is always seems like the biggest obstacle for me. Thanks for advice. 
Ya, Toptal does sound hard to get into. Also, it's probably more beneficial for me to get a real-world, non-remote job starting out anyways if I want to learn as much as possible from people that know what they're doing. 

How many projects did you have in your portfolio? Did they tend to be large-scale or were they quite small? I need more projects in my portfolio created with my own mind. Hopefully I can create enough in the next 3 months or so to impress somebody. 
This sounds like a very practical, interesting idea. Any idea how I would market my potential FedEx/USPS API "expertise"? It sounds like a very niche thing, so I would be taking away focus from other things to learn the API, but it also sounds like there is demand. 

Just wondering how much demand there is and how I could begin to drum up interest as a contractor for this niche thing. 

Also, are there any other niche things that I could learn that developers find tiresome, but could also help me break into the industry? 
I would say, put the tutorials up, but do a little work to change them a bit or build on it a tad.  It shows that you get the concepts.  Being able to follow a tutorial is nice, but showing you understand the core concepts and can build upon it is key.

If you have an idea, just do it!  What helps me is a paper prototype, writing down all the pieces to make the idea happen, then you just work on one little piece at a time, so that it's not overwhelming.

And if you put all of that into Github, you'll have a really nice portfolio eventually, but it takes time and effort to get there.  You also don't need a ton of projects, a couple well made or unique projects that show your creativity and ability to make things is better than 10 Vanilla tutorial projects that don't do much.  I think after a few years of doing side projects I only have 9 or so projects in Github, since I deleted all of my tutorial projects once I had actual side projects to keep.

Good luck!
I don't think remote is bad at all, as long as you can do work from home. I hate commuting, plus office life is distracting at times. 

Had a few ranging from basic tic-tac-toe, to a project that had a backend and was hosted on Heroku. 

You could always use one of the tutorials you have done and improve on it. That way you will understand it and can explain it. It also skips the stage of needing to come up with the idea.
You could market your expertise by fixing a problem with a neglected e-commerce web application or just answering questions that appear on various developer message boards. 

Other niche things I've run into are a special credit card issued to military personnel. Most e-commerce web applications don't have a payment processor for this special payment option but if a business sells anything of interest to military personnel then they need some custom code written to handle it. I think it was the [Military Star Exchange Credit Program](https://www.myecp.com/). 
So many people posting in this sub looking to get away from Linode.

Me, I want the VPS provider who can have all this thrown at them and is still fucking standing.
An attack of this size was done by someone/some team with a substantial amount of backing. Maintaining an attack of this size and complexity also wouldn't be easy, especially a professional hosting company like Linode.

I'm extremely curious as to who's behind this attack.
You probably don't want to pay for it, though.
That's not handled by your host, that's handled by your architecture. Multiple data centers acting in parallel are the only way to avoid catastrophic failures like this. It'd be great if Linode could get their shit together, but attacks like this happen and the only answer is app architecture. 
Reading the post, almost all of the attacks are volumetric ("dumb").

The problem with this kind of attack is that the costs are extremely asymmetrical (botnets and bandwidth is cheap, complexity is zero, mitigation is an expensive nightmare). 

So, you can imagine what a well-funded volumetric attack is like for the defender ...

Somebody like Cloudflare who can take advantage of anycast IPs and filtering across their global network have it much easier, because their primary business (CDN) inherently provides them the ability to soak abuse. Linode, being datacentre and service focused, can only resource their global network defences so much ...
CloudFlare also wouldn't be able to keep Linode up though. Their mitigation strategies are designed to keep websites online during a DDoS attack. To that end they leverage distributed caching, ICMP response limiting, UDP dropping, and so on. While fine for a website you cannot cache a service nor limit UDP or ICMP requests to a service that needs them.

The kind of mitigation services that can keep more than just a website online during an attack are extremely expensive and only effective to the limits of their bandwidth and scrubbing capacity. 

I cited in another thread the examples of PSN and Xbox Live. Sony and Microsoft are mutli-billion dollar companies with huge distributed networks and they still go down under the weight of some DDoS attacks.

DDoS attacks are battles of capacity not skill. They can do some things like move bottle neck targets and such but by the sounds of it every time they get ahead of the attacker the attacks change.
This article is good, however it is really basic.

Please take the time to learn version control.  I've interviewed/worked with many devs that say they "know" Git, but really don't.  It sucks dealing with a repo when merges conflicts are not resolved properly.  

Thanks abdlmalek for posting a link to this guide. :-)

Git is a nightmare. Yes, it's a powerful solution, and it has taken over mere "version control" to become a mainstay in every developer's workflow -both frontend and backend- for good reason. 

But it's the proverbial necessary evil. It's over-engineered because it needs to be, and it's a devious, bastard of a program.

If git has not yet brought your whole project to a screeching halt, making you want to throw your entire computer and your life's work out a window, it's because you're not using it very much.

The solution is still in its infancy. Hopefully, inevitably, some one or company will develop the "Windows" to the current "DOS" state of git.  We're going to look back on this era a few years from now and wonder how the hell anyone ever got by on such a primitive, caveman-esque tool for collaboration. 

And I'm a full supporter of command line. I get the efficiency of utilizing command tools which a GUI could never accomplish. But git is an absolute cluster fuck of options. A maddening network of switches for specific scenarios, which have history and logic that can only be understood after experimenting, reading, StackExchange referencing and memorizing. Not because it's intuitive, but because that's the way it is. 

In short, you need git, but you're going to find it confusing if you try to use it to the degree that its intended. Don't feel bad, it's not just you. It *is* confusing. 

While git "works" in the production quality code sense, it has yet to fully mature into a humanized product. We are the pioneers in this case, who will soon bemoan new developers for how easy it is to wrangle and fully utilize git... but that may be a few years.

Also, yeah, for now, pretty good article. 

Edit: A lot of assumptions about my level of experience. I'm not ranting because I don't understand it, I'm ranting because I've been using it for years.
I'd like to recommend https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git because finally I understood Git workflow and basic commands.
http://think-like-a-git.net/

^ That tutorial's good for teaching you more about branching. Branching is a pretty fundamental part of using Git in a collaborative environment (and even in your own personal projects), so you're going to have to learn a little bit more about it if you want to use it correctly.
Ugh, I really need to start using Git.  I've attempted it before with not much success.   I'm definitely going to check this link out.  Hopefully something will click this time.
Is there any downside to having your website publicly available on git since it costs money to have private repos? I'm worried about someone being able to read all your code and finding a security flaw since everything related to your website is pushed onto a public space. I understand the usefulness of having git to collaborate but if I'm the sole coder is it still a good idea? I'm currently using a local repo to handle all of my code and I'm hesitant about publishing it onto github. Can someone give me some insight into if this is good practice?
I just last night attempted command line git. It took me a very long time to actual get my changed files to github.

I apparently had to re-add then after I edit them.

Anyway thanks for posting this. I have much to learn, in the attempt to move away from the windows GUI
Sounds like a stupid question but is git only worth using in collaborative projects? I used to use it for push and pulls at my old company where the lead Dev was great at everything and I just took ages to learn things. 

I hated it! I hated using command line and sorting version conflicts and all the other crap that came with it so how necessary is it really?

Seems like something I can't avoid :(
I've used many SCM tools over the years, and I think git is needlessly arcane -- with the accent on *needlessly*. If you've ever managed a group of developers with widely varying skill sets, you can probably appreciate the time costs of a junior developer making poor decisions and big mistakes when merging/committing code changes -- or worse yet trying to "fix" those mistakes after the fact. Git is not the only DVCS in the world.

Take Mercurial as a comparison. The commands are intuitive and simple (clone, pull, push, commit, shelve, update, branch, merge,...) and the operations are fast on big projects. The learning curve is much less steep and there's not much if anything git offers that Mercurial doesnt have. I'm not against git (in fact I use it on some projects) but to say that git *needs* to be the way it is just ain't so.
I prefer my tree of changes visualized when I work with it. That is why I use https://github.com/FredrikNoren/ungit
Git is all good until you get an error and dont understand why, you google it and try the solutions, nothing happens, and you just forget the error even exists until you need to cross paths with that one branch.
Can you expound on this? I think I'm one of those who just "knows" Git. I guess I haven't really used it more than a convenient code repository. 
Yup, literally the hardest part about using git is that your teammates are also using it.

> It's over-engineered because it needs to be

Over-engineered? All the complaints I've heard is that it's under-engineered in the frontend and that this makes the UI a pain, something remedied by trivial memorization or writing a bunch of aliases.

Git itself is an example of fantastic engineering.
You should branch your projects properly and everything becomes easier immediately. If learning the options feel cumbersome, you can choose from a variety of plugins for different platforms which hide all the commands under a straight forward UI.

The paradigm git lives in is not well understood, but git is a very efficient realisation of that paradigm. Consider the likes of SVN - git is infinitely better.

I, as everyone else, use git all the time. Frankly I've no idea how much more time projects would take without it. We've not had a problem with halts, because we use branches. There shouldn't ever be conflicts you don't know how to solve if you branch efficiently. If you find yourself looking for obscure switches often, then it might be a sign that you want to recover from an erroneous state often. The medicine for this is to reevaluate your structure. Believe me, I'm speaking from experience.

The one thing I'd fault git for is some of their naming choices, which sometimes seem to assume a context that might not exist. For instance, "yours" and "theirs". I'd much more prefer local vs. server or something similar.
Have you used other VCS? The way you write it seems like you've never experienced the horror of SVN.
Try learning how to use it properly beyond memorizing a few commands, and you won't need to rant about it like this. Git is fantastic. 
Yeah, the UI of git isn't very usable. I think the "Windows" of git is Github, Gitlab and other web interfaces.

Perhaps you should try [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)?
You should take a day to actually understand git. 
Man I just need to squash all my shit commits really easily. 
[deleted]
Bitbucket is free (assuming your team is small). 

You don't need to host on github - your remote could be your own vps, a computer on your network (that you trust) or even a HDD. Obviously all this depends on your team and their access needs. 
If you can't afford $9/month, don't use it.
`git status` is your friend.
Re-add? Never encountered that before. Are you sure they were added in the first place?
If you're already tracking files (as in they've already previously been added to your repo) then you can do a quick "git add -u" to add all versioned files that have been changed. 

Something I learned about recently is that you can do a "git commit -am <message>" to both add your files and do the commit command in one line, though to be perfectly honest I'm not sure if the -a flag is more akin to a "git add -A" which adds all files in your local repo that aren't set to be ignored in your .gitignore, to the "git add -u" which I described above. I'd only use this command if you're 1000% sure of exactly what you're committing when running the command.

Anyway. I'm a big supporter of learning command line stuff. My logic is that keeping your fingers on your keyboard allows you to maintain unbroken productivity, as opposed to stopping and getting your mouse and navigating, but I get that it's not for everyone. It couldn't hurt to try it. There are tons of cool git commands that even I'm still learning as git is a pretty comprehensive application that most of us only use to a fraction of its potential.
Not a fan of the CLI either. What really helped me was using [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/). 
No, it works great for solo work too. It helps keep individual changes atomic and separated. It's useful if you use multiple computers, and useful for deployment too.
Imagine you're working on a project without git and your hard drive dies. The only copy of that work gone and you'll have to start from scratch assuming you don't have a copy on a deployment server or something.

With git this scenario is as easy as just replacing the drive and doing  "git clone" to jump right back in where you left off.

I also find it's nice to be able to do commits on my projects after major additions so if I fuck something up I can always just jump back to a previous point where I know all the stuff worked.

And as someone else mentioned it's convenient for deploying because you do a push with your local code and then go to the server, pull, build, restart your server and you're done.
It's mandatory in the professional field, more or less. You don't need to use command line though. Use an IDE with a thorough plugin, or some other independent GUI. GitHub maintains a pretty good one.

One thing with git is that it's the first touch to version control many have. There are lots of things there which have been implemented because of the greater scope a VC requires. Many question why you have to commit and push when they first begin using git, because the benefit isn't apparent in a starter project. When you get deeper into a more complex project, the design choices begin to make sense.

So it pays to remember that you're most likely learning git AND version control at the same time. In that sense, diving deeper into git might benefit you, because it reveals why a lot of things work as they do - a perspective you won't have if you aren't well versed in version control options.
No, it's great for personal projects. But perhaps you want to try another version control software like mercurial?
While I'm not an expert.. yet. These resources changed the way I use Git:

* https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/
Here is a litmus test I use, but it really isn't comprehensive.  But the links /u/nawfel_bgh are good.  I would add https://git-scm.com/

* What is the difference between branches`origin foo`, `origin/foo` and `foo` (on your machine).
* rebase vs merge
* amend, rebase -i, etc
* pull vs fetch + <another command>
* How to add/remove remotes
* If two commits have identical code diff and commit message and the SHAs is different, what happened?

Edit:word

In addition to other replies, look up the gitflow workflow as where you work will most likely use some loose derivative of this process.

So it is over-engineered. It's supposed to be a tool for you, yet people are creating other tools such as git GUIs to be able to work with it. One my friends showed me how to rewrite the history by reorganizing 'pick' lines on a terminal, I thought it cannot get more complicated than that.
SVN, horror?

SVN is beautiful beautiful stuff compared to CVS and Visual Source Safe that don't track commits but rather individual files. Let alone Perforce and the other god awful stuff.

Yes, Git is good and Mercurial is fine, but SVN is not dire. Save that for the stuff it replaced.
svn is easily a bigger nightmare.
Stick to CLI, it won't lie to you.
Disclaimer I suck at git.

I find github desktop can get you in some really fucky situations really easily. Sometimes it just doesn't tell you what it's doing/did or might start doing things you don't want it to do.

Changing branches with the github desktop app vs. command line was always way more confusing for me than it needed to be. It's really hard to tell when you are looking at a branch vs checking out a branch vs merged to a branch etc.

The app does a really bad job of telling you what the current state of the files on your computer are too. Which branch are the files on my computer last synced up to, which files are up to date, etc. etc. The desktop app needs a lot of work. Compared to p4v and tortoisesvn it's night and day as far as information about your current workspace.

That said, I should put more effort into learning command line git and it might make the ui make more sense or at least make it easier for me to get myself out of holes I got myself into.

It just sucks because I know git has all the functionality to have the same features, the desktop app just lacks all of them.
git rebase -i HEAD~5 

Fixup or squash depending on what commit messages you care about.
Use branches! Use them all the time! Use them as you would classes for an OOP language. Slice and dice into features, and then slice them if need be. No one should face a situation where they have to merge something they do not know how to merge. If you branch the right way, then backtracking is easy too.

Files saved on the desktop? What is this heresy! When working with git there should be no reason to have to do such a thing. Make a new local branch for backup, if you need to.

Check out [this](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/).
That's because your team doesn't understand how to use Git and branches to work together.

It's not GIT fault if someone doesn't refresh their working branches before starting work. Obviously you'll have issues when it's time to merge that back in.
Thanks! i'm pretty new so learning about git was always in reference to github. Bitbucket seems awesome!
You have to add to the commit. For a novice the commands look like the initial commit. I'm pretty sure that is what he is talking about.
Which is fine until you want to do something vaguely complicated, at which point it's impossible and you have to use the CLI anyway except now you have no idea at all what you're doing.
Besides that, branchs are great for working on new features :)
Thought someone might say that! 
Eh, even without a remote copy it's already incredibly useful to be able to alter your files without fear because you know you can rollback to a previous version.
I assume this only really comes into play with bespoke projects? 

I do a lot of graphic design work and Wordpress sites where it doesn't seem to be as useful. If I go back to working for an agency on custom projects I can see myself using guy again
> One thing with git is that it's the first touch to version control many have.

I think this really depends on how old you are. Even 5 years ago it wasn't that big in my industry and it only really really started picking up steam around us in the last 2-3 years. It was still around, but it definitely wasn't the first thing people would think about when thinking about version control.
Started looking into these. Thanks for sharing. 

Can you also share the kind of answers you'd be looking for? That'll be helpful as well.

**Edit:** These are my answers. Please let me know if I'm mistaken anywhere.

> What is the difference between branches origin foo, origin/foo and foo (on your machine).

* origin foo = branch name
* origin/foo = remote name/branch name
* foo = branch name


> rebase vs merge

rebase moves the beginning of your branch to a different (usually later?) commit from the master branch (could be a different branch?


> amend, rebase -i, etc

amend allows you to modify last commit. rebase -i allows you to modify multiple commits.

> pull vs fetch + <another command>

* pull = fetch + merge
* fetch = download new repo data, do not do a merge

another command? Not sure what that is referring to.

> How to add/remove remotes

* git remote add <nickname> <url>
* git remote rm <nickname>

> If two commits have identical code diff and commit message and the SHAs is different, what happened?

Commits in different branches. Possibly cherry-picked from another branch?
I am one of the guilty developers that 'knows how to use git', but couldn't answer these questions. Time to read up, cheers.
I don't know the answer to any of these and use git all the time..... :/
The fact that there are lots of options doesn't mean it's over engineered. It means the problem being solved is complex and there's lots of ground to cover.
>Better than Visual Source Safe

That bar is set so low, it's at the bottom of the Mariana trench.
Yeah, I do.
Thanks. I just found that link at Google, never used Github Desktop. The only GUI I use is [Gitg](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Gitg?action=AttachFile&do=view&target=history.png), to visualize the commit history. But it doesn't really make any change to the repository, it just visualizes the commits, files, etc.
Shit, never thought of using HEAD in that way. I always just

    git rebase -i master-repo/develop
That's great when it's only your commits
Started using branches and love them.... Then, I tried reverting a merge damn, what happened there?
The bleeding obvious is obvious, once you get to know git. There is a bit of a hurdle to get over to get into it though.
Yep. GUIs are bad because it's not giving you the control, it's abstracting it just to look pretty.

CLI GIT is dead simple and will make you better. If you run into a wall, CLI will be the only way out.
Sure, you can't change history if people know what happened already. 
It's not about that but keeping it so it's clean.
My advice would be to read MEAN stack blog articles and ask the author if they want to be hired.

However, I consider myself well-versed in the MEAN stack and enjoy teaching webdev stuff to others. PM me if you want to talk more in detail about it! 
Hi, good day thanks for replying. May I know how much your rate is and what app have you made using MEAN? 

Thanks for the tip in getting authors as MEAN mentors. 
Let me ask this: If the ORM encrypted and decrypted data transparently, wouldn't anyone with RCE access to the application be able to read back that sensitive data without even realising it's encrypted?

Where are the keys being stored such that someone could compromise the server but not he keys?

I would start by thinking about the type of attack you are trying to prevent (threat modelling) and then consider the type of mitigation for that attack. With that covered, correct encryption implementation will be somewhat obvious.
What are you planning to use for a database? Nodejs doesn't store your data. If you use MySQL I'd recommend AES_ENCRYPT and AES_DECRYPT. I don't have a lot of experience in Mongodb so I'm not sure what the best way to handle it there is. Keep in mind that encrypting a database is only one aspect of keeping an application secure. If someone gets hold of your encryption key it doesn't matter how fancy the encryption algorithm is. And are a bajillion other ways a hacker can view that unencrypted data.
You make a very good point, though I'm not sure I understand what RCE means. Would you mind explaining that to me? (I have a hunch that it means remote code execution?)


I believe the threat I am trying to mitigate is that of the db server being compromised and an attacker doing a data dump. (If the database was being hosted separately from the app)

As far as I know my encryption and decryption keys would contained in the app code (specifically env variables when using Express and nocr)

Im thinking now that my implementation will be that of the app and db running on the same machine. Assuming that data in transit is secured via HTTPS, inputs are sanitized,general threats such as XSS is protected against using Helmet.js, and that the server itself is secured using SSH key authentication + IDS/IPS, what are the ways that an attacker could get the db information without compromising the system?

Im also thinking now that Im just being paranoid and wishing to provide another level of security in an edge case scenario that might not even be possible :$?
> AES_ENCRYPT and AES_DECRYPT


Unauthenticated ECB mode. Not a good recommendation.

> (I have a hunch that it means remote code execution?)

That's exactly right. Look at the recent Joomla vulnerabilities as a good example of this. If you compromise a vulnerable Joomla server, you basically get the ability to execute PHP code as though it was part of the Joomla code. So any encryption there is useless.

I'm *not* saying encryption is worthless, just that it's not the magic bullet it's often portrayed as. It's certainly valid that a separately hosted database is less of a risk if it contains encrypted data.

Think about things like this: Is there data that you can encrypt going in, and not necessarily need to be able to able to decrypt at all as a non-admin user? You can build your key management around that.

Top end security for things like credit card numbers often involves the use of [Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/), which is from the Vagrant team.


Not necessarily. Granted it requires a relatively newer version of MySQL and changing a system variable.
[As far as I can see](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb/aes_encrypt/), that variable does nothing in Mariadb, which is what the majority of users are now running when they say "MySQL".

Moreover, using a modern variable to force *unauthenticated* CBC mode, is a dangerous step backwards.
Meh, Apache. Nginx is where it's at. ;)

As a web developer from Atlanta, the whole time I was reading this list I was thinking how Atlanta is a great candidate for this list considering the surplus of jobs and cheap housing. Pleasant surprise to find it at #1. 

I think if you know .NET or Java, employers will literally pick you off the street here in Atlanta. 
Live 2 hours away from Chicago, IL. Currently been applying to jobs there. Would be a great city to move to. Glad to see it there!
Heyo Boston Represent.

Here's the thing though, you can get places in Boston easily a 30 minute commute from the city for 300-350k instead of 520k.

The problem is there are a lot of expensive areas that tilt that number up (although I would assume this is the case for all cities).

That said, Boston is a pretty cool place to be a Web Dev.
I'm a dev in Austin and might be feeling the itch to move. Born and raised in Texas and won't leave the south for the frigid north. What are the best places to work in Atlanta? Also, is it as much like Houston and Dallas as it seems (never been)? By that I mean big, sprawling, and decentralized. Not a fan of spending a ton of time in my car.
Yeah, the title should be "The 10 best US cities for web developers". :/
[deleted]
Besides the traffic and having half the tech companies up in Alpharetta, ATL is really great. Recently, I've been going to some of the meetup groups and what-nots, very active community and people are always recruiting.  
Yeah, I'm a dev in Atlanta and I kept thinking of how it's such a good city for web dev. 
Are you telling me you make half a million a year doing web development?!
Atlanta wouldn't be for you then either. That's just the nature of southern cities. There's a lot of space so everything is spread out. 
You probably need to get out more.
He is talking about the median home price category.
[deleted]
Hah, shit I wish.  Maybe if i started my own company I could get there.  No I make a little less than the median wage atm, but was talking about housing prices.
Yeah I mean I get that. There are some southern cities that aren't that bad. Austin does technically sprawl thanks to the suburbs, but everything that's *really* Austin is relatively centralized. New Orleans is kind of that way too. Dallas and Houston on the other hand are just totally different beasts. Multiple CBDs, very few urban residential neighborhoods, etc. I live in downtown Austin (which has a ton of residential) and hardly every travel outside of a 2 mile radius.

But I'm sure you're right about Atlanta. That's exactly what I was worried about.
I did but it was US oriented so... not for me, I'm trying my luck in Berlin soon.
Off course, thanks for the clarification.

How are you applying?  Job listings?  What worked best for me to find my first job after being self taught was to find agencies in my area and email them directly.  Introduce yourself and talk about your projects.  
Also your site isn't responsive. I'm checking you out on mobile and that's a big deal.
Ohhh that's a really good suggestion.  No I haven't been doing that.  I've just been applying on Dice mainly.  

How did you find the agency, and did you need to do white boarding problems often?  (So many problems.......)
Oh I thought it was. Thanks for the update. I'll fix it
My android is working. What kind of mobile device did you use?
Search web agencies in 'your city'.Also, on google maps go to your city and search web agencies and a bunch will pop up.  Those were my primary methods.  From there I just picked out the ones that I liked and sent them a message.  Dice has given me the worst luck, indeed is a lot better imo if you are going with listings.

I havent had to do any coding at an interview yet, just some basic technical questions and showing and talking about my projects at most of them.
An android also.
Ah that's smart.  Thanks for the info, especially on Dice.  Cheers :)
No problem,  Good luck!

Worst case scenario just keep making projects and applying, you will get something eventually!
Thank for your advice and luck!
Will do!
> What we want : Ability to check a file out. In the perfect world, I would check a file out, and he would see that I am working on that file. This way he doesn't make changes to it.

this is really inefficient. i know you think git is overly complex, but it is the standard for a reason. do yourself a favor and learn the basic commands and you won't regret it.
Hi, have you tried looking at [Perforce](https://www.perforce.com/perforce/doc.current/manuals/p4v/introduction.about.html)?

I think you could probably get away with just installing the client (Visual Client, Admin Tool, Visual Merge Tool, Command-Line Client).

Downloads: https://www.perforce.com/downloads/helix#clients

It's packaged so that you only need to download the one "Helix P4V: Visual Client" file and you can install all of the client modules.

You'll have to configure things in the Admin client first (like creating users, groups, workspaces, depots) then you can probably just use the normal client after that.

Within the client you can see files that are checked out, out of date, locked, you can "Diff" (compare) any new updates and resolve versions if you're both working in the same area.

I think you may need to copy the files over to your test server manually, (or create a daemon which uploads files in a specific folder for you) - The server software may handle this, though I haven't really looked into it.
TFS?  There's a free cloud hosted version available on visualstudio.com
For two people working in offices right next to eachother, with no outside help, no one else will ever need to access this data except the two of us or our replacements, I believe git is far above and beyond what we need.  We've installed it twice, tried it once with Git and once with Mercurial, and both are just a pain to work with and slow everything we do down.
Funny downvotes all throughout here.

Perforce is perfect.  Except that it seems to be...Uh...Appending all files in the depot with a ,v.  So like, our testsite is now full of *.html,v files...Which uh, defeats the whole purpose of a website, because like, it won't work.

I'm about ready to revert to using notecards and carrier pigeons.
The depot is the way that you can look back on previous file revisions. You need a depot (a massive log of all the files), a workspace (your local copy) and then the testsite and livesite.

Here's some documentation on how you could set it up (seems a bit dated though) https://www.perforce.com/perforce/doc.current/manuals/p4ftp/chapter.install.html#install.dreamweaver.updating

I believe you could just make a new "shared" workspace as the testsite ie; Create a new workspace with the Workspace root pointed at the location that you want. You can then sync all the files with Right Click -> Get Latest Revision. ( I just tried this and it works, but not sure if it will work out for you in a practical sense ).

No, it expired a few weeks ago. I am past that grace period. Right now, I can't renew/reactivate it and is only available for more than 150$ from DomainAgents (I bought the domain on NameCheap)
If you can get it for $150, that's a bargain.

I had one expire, and the squatter who bought it wanted tens of thousands.
Pay the $ and chalk it up as a life lesson.
It's probably in "redemption", which is a couple weeks after the grace period and is a standard by ICANN. $150 is more expensive than some, but I'd get it back while you still can. 
This. I had a personal domain years ago that had hardly any traffic and I let it expire. When I tried to get it back some company snatched it and wanted like 16 grand. I still get weekly emails from them asking me if I'm ready to buy it back yet. 
As far as I understand this is not a squatter, since the domain isn't available to puchase now. I had time to reactivate it, and now it's available there before it expires.
I'm relatively new to this freelancing thing so take what I say with a grain of salt, but..

I have had a bit of success finding work on /r/forhire. I'm still working full time so I'm quite happy to keep the volume of work quite low, but I do have a plan to go full time freelance in the near future. Maybe 6 months or so. 

I always use a contract, even for the tiniest of jobs. I just use a contract template I found on a website years ago.. I forget where it's from but it's very basic. Just what is expected, how the product can be used and how I'm going to get paid basically.

I ask for a 50% upfront deposit for any online/remote work and the rest on completion before I hand over any source code. This sometimes changes if I have past history with a client and I know they are trustworthy, or if it is a tiny job that wouldn't kill me if I wasn't paid. I'm pessimistic.. but I think it's the safest way to be. If it's local work where I can actually meet with the client face to face, I will often ask for a smaller deposit.


Contracts on smaller projects are generally a waste of time since the cost of legal fees will ensure that no matter what happens the contract doesn't really fulfill any purpose. I require a fifty percent deposit on smaller projects & anyone who tells you not to require some kind of deposit is probably very green to freelancing.  If clients don't want to pay this then you're probably better off waiting for better clients then getting screwed & getting a small amount of money for a lot of effort. 
I set a maximum invoice amount and split the project into deliverables that correspond to it.

For me I would try to never invoice over $2,000 and make sure for every invoice I provide I'm giving them something. Depending on the project you could break it down into $500 amounts.

An example is you have a site that's expected to cost $5,000 and you decide to limit the invoices to $1,000. You break the project up into 5 more or less equal parts and invoice at the end of each part.

I've been burnt in the past with giving large invoices by clients who weren't great with cash flow (ie they knew that a $5,000 invoice would be due 3 months from now but when I finally gave it to them it took them an extra 3 - 4 months to pay).

It's also good step towards being more 'agile' if you're into that...

Edit: I've never taken a down payment and I think this method allows you to take that risk if you're worried that a down payment won't fly.
Communication with your client is huge, upfront and once the project gets started. Better to be on the "slightly annoying" part of the spectrum than non-responsive until major project milestones are reached IMO. 

No downpayment in my experience. The contract is usually drawn up by the client and you can review and sign after. 

Payment structure is up to you but making it clear up front is key. Depending on how big the project is it might make sense to get paid once a month or bi-monthly if there's a lot of functionality introduced to something that's already live. Using time tracking software is essential for recording how many hours were actually spent on a project and a lot of them will provide you with text fields as to what work was done that day and summarize it nicely at the end of the week so you can show the client.

A lot of it depends on contract to contract but after a while you kind of get in a groove that works for you and afterwards you adjust per client as they need to. This of course is just my experience and others may have more concrete advice. 
[deleted]
This is all on point. 

Concerning payment, I agree that in most cases down payment is unnecessary. However, after the work is completed they have to pay promptly otherwise that relationship is over. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVkLVRt6c1U
I see that's for the great response, do you recommend any time tracking software? 
Not taking a down payment is a risky move, unless you're talking about something that is going to take you like a day or two. Always ask for 50% up front. If someone gives you that much before the project even gets started it's a very good sign that they aren't fucking around.
I concur that you need a downpayment. There is pretty much no reason not to ask for one, and it should be at least 50%. 

Contracts though, it depends. Individuals or small companies, its generally a good idea unless you know them fairly well. However, if the project is < $3000, going to small claims court is probably not going to be worth the trouble. Personally, I won't do projects for individuals or small companies anymore. They are generally too much hassle. Large established companies (ie. > 500 employees, 100mil/yr+ revenue, etc.), you can charge like $50,000 and they won't even blink. I have yet to actually set up a contract with a company like this. They always pay, and usually very quickly. 
I work primarily with [Freckle](https://letsfreckle.com/) and it suits my needs but there are plenty of others out there worth researching. 

Regarding the no down payment comments below. While I agree if you're working on huge projects that extend for months and the payment schedule is irregular or scarce; sure ask for a down payment. Most clients I've had don't have an issue paying me every two weeks or once a month making the argument "what if they don't pay you" somewhat irrelevant as I will just stop giving them updates until payment clears. In my experience I've had no issues with 90% of my clients, the 10% that have given me trouble have eventually paid me and the non-payment was usually due to clerical errors more than unwillingness to pay. But then again, if you get burned once or twice, you may want to draw up a contract and go down that route. Starting out as a freelancer I usually advise the path of least resistance at least until you've got a couple of committed contracts under your belt. Good luck! 
How do you get freelance work with large companies? Don't they usually go to established agencies?
Just personal connections. It's probably not likely to happen any other way TBH.
You could do that - but since it sounds like you want to store more than one item of data, you could use a data-attribute on the body or the html tag and store JSON-encoded data in there, to save space in the header and easier information retrieval.
Right. To expand on this, you may want to use something like AngularJS if you need your frontend code to be data-driven like this. It's simply not semantic or the best way to store contextual, sessional data with meta tags. 
For stuff like this I sometimes use sessionStorage.setItem() / sessionStorage.getItem(). 

Works on IE8 and up and everywhere else (except OperaMini)
You don't need angular, but it will do quite a lot for you - even a lot you won't understand at first. Use whatever you like best. Getting the data is a simple one-liner in vanilla JS:

    var pageInfo = JSON.parse(document.body.getAttribute('data-page-info'));

Unfortunately, there's many, many things that could cause this, both on the host's side and other factors such as theme code on your site. It's probably worth opening a ticket with them to see what they tell you.
Looks like pretty normal numbers for vanilla Wordpress on shared hosting.

The initial request takes forever yet all the assets are relatively snappy, so it doesn't look like a networking problem.

Wordpress is pretty slow all by itself. One of the popular caching plugins is pretty much required, so I encourage you to check them out (first google link: https://premium.wpmudev.org/blog/top-wordpress-caching-plugins/).

Use google to find Wordpress performance tuning advice. There's a lot of low-hanging fruit just by toggling things off in the admin panel.

If you're running on shared hosting, then you're sharing resources with other apps that may be starving you of memory and especially CPU. It's the main downside of shared hosting and it's why it's so cheap.
I should mention this is for mainly static pages on a WordPress framework.
Probably not your hoster, maybe the scripts generating/theming your content ? Too many things can cause this.

*wordpress is slow by default*
Whilst it could be any of a number of things, the fact you call them a "hosting company" suggests you're looking at a cPanel type arrangement - in which case, it's a safe bet that's your cause.
I'm in a similar position (shared hosting, php/MySQL). I don't need each page to be generated at request time so I'm looking into using a static site generator like Hexo to bring TTFB down to static asset speeds. 
You can rule out the entirety of the front end though. In the back end there probably are not that many places it could be - the server itself (eg Apache), the database, then the server side code. The latter of course may have several layers to it but it's pretty simple to eliminate candidates like plugins/themes by turning them off one by one.
Ok, thanks for that. I'm not currently running any caching plugins so I'll look into it.
Static as in using something like w3 cache? 
Yeah it's shared hosting through Network Solutions.
Another thing to try would be to hit a new (non browser cached) static resource in isolation e.g. an image that won't be served via any of the usual Wordpress hoopla.
Just get yourself a DigitalOcean VPS, it'll only cost you $5/mo.  Well, maybe a little bit more if you need email.
Wow, that did make a difference. Loading a direct image brings me into the 60ms range. 
What has Google used Dart for?  gmail or google apps?
I think Dart and Typescript are great, but I'd never get the greenlight to roll with either one. I've had to fight uphill just to get ES6 at most jobs.
Instead of inventing dozens of compile-to-javascript languages they should create proposals and push new ES20xx standards. Babel and the other transpilers will do the rest. Some day^TM they might even be mainstream enough to be used directly
The text said nothing tbh... Nothing
What a politically correct pile of garbage. "Everyone's opinion is valid!". 
Medium.com is just the worst. Rename it to Opinion.com, please. It's just a blog.
Google Fiber, Google Ads, and their entire internal CMS. Those are the big ones so far. But there are many other projects that they aren't willing to disclose yet being built with it.

[And lots more!](https://www.dartlang.org/community/who-uses-dart.html)
I don't understand why higher ups say no to es6. Nearly every codebase has a build step, and it's nearly invisible using babel. 
There is a proposed WebAssembly thingy which, correctly if im wrong, attempts to implement "compilers" in web so you can run any programming language in the web and it will compile to native.
The argument for doing something like Dart instead of that is largely about speed. It takes a very long time to get changes made to JS, and they have to be incremental in order to avoid being too disruptive. To get JS anywhere near the state of a solid language like Dart would take many years, and Google wants to make huge web apps in a productive way right now. JS has some fundamental flaws, too, that can't be worked around without a clean break.

Remember also that, unlike many other compile-to-JS languages, Dart is really its own separate, general-purpose language with its own virtual machine. Dart has many more goals aside from making web app devs' lives easier, like targeting mobile platforms and microcontrollers.
That's certainly true. Uninformed opinions are undoubtedly not valid.
> It's just a blog.

No.. shit? That's sort of the point of Medium.com? 
It doesn't really claim to be anything else... it's user-driven content.

&nbsp;

> *Medium is a community of readers and writers offering unique perspectives on ideas large and small.*
That argument would apply to TypeScript and Dart, too.
It's not quite the same thing though. Es6 will be supported for the foreseeable future and become more widely used over the next 5 years *without a doubt*. Typescript and Dart don't have nearly as large a userbase or support so it's much more of a risk to use, both for hireability and long term support. Google seems to be the only place that uses Dart in production as far as I know of, and typescript is likely to get overshadowed by better designed typed compile-to-js languages like Purescript, (and Dart). 

That said, I'd be happy to see Dart adopt more popularity. It looks pretty nice from what I've seen and has similar tooling to Go, which is pretty well recognised as the best out there. 
Here are my notes:

[this](http://imgur.com/MYtl5RC) is what I see when I open it on chrome. You need to fix the spacing so things aren't overlapping.

On your resume page, what is the purpose of the giant W's? They are very distracting.

I'm not sure you should have a photostream of your family on your portfolio website...

I don't mind the listing for the portfolio, but i think images are a more effective way of showing that info, and makes it more enticing to click the links. Maybe you could show a thumbnail aligned to the right?

Lastly, it is unclear how people are supposed to contact you. I think you should make it very clear. Maybe add a footer with the info?

Your surfpl thing is pretty cool though!
nothing wrong with it. you're doing great
Why are you ruling out smaller view ports? I don't see anything on your site that could not be arranged on a mobile. 

It loads fine on iPad. I went to look at your portfolio work and there was no links so it didn't have any impact on me as there was just a short project description.
Looks great to me! Reading the text in that last div on the frontpage was a little hard on my eyes but that's probably just me.
I would recommend putting a couple of ctas on the home page that link to pages in the nav as I didn't immediately notice that the nav was there at all.

The color scheme on the portfolio page is a little hard on the eyes. Maybe try making it a bit less 'neon'

The Teklist application is pretty neat. Maybe add a browse function instead of only being able to search.

Oh man that looks horrible. I don't know why it happens, but on my chrome desktop browser, everything looks okay, even if I change the window size (I use a chrome plugin to test this). But when I check it out on my phone, I get something similar. I'll definitely have to fix this up though.

The giant W's is UW's logo :) I can see how it would seem funny though, seeing as all 3 jobs I have listed have been at UW.

I can see what you mean about the photostream. Part of my justification is that these are photos that I would likely have uploaded to a public blog of sorts, but I guess this is a little different. Would having that reflect negatively for potential employers? It'd be cool to get a few more honest opinions on the matter before I shelf it :)

Thanks a bunch for your time and notes. I'm compiling a list of to-dos and your thoughts have been very helpful!
Err.. I guess it's just for the surfpl portion. That particular one was designed specifically for larger viewports.

For the portfolio, not all of them have live links or source code, but the ones that do will show it when you click on the project (it expands to show more details).

Do you think it'd be better to have all of them expanded to begin with?

Thanks for your time
geonames?

http://download.geonames.org/export/dump/
I bet there is a Google API for that.
I checked everything, but I got soo lost with the .txt files from the dump.

Looking at them again I forgot to check google for how to import them as someone has probably posted something somewhere.
From a business perspective, you should probably have some information about your product on your website. Benefits, values, etc.

Personally, I just forward ports from my router to make my local websites available over the internet, but I can see this being very useful to a lot of people.
Looks great - some details about how it works would be good as I'm a bit worried about sharing a potentially sensitive localhost build with a third party extension.
Great point, the website is pretty bare-bones currently.
Thanks for the feedback! That's definitely a fair point, and I'm working on improving the homepage so that it communicates how Flowcast works better.

At a high level, Flowcast acts as a proxy for requests coming in on your <username>.flowca.st subdomain. 

On a more granular level, the Flowcast server forwards requests coming in on your subdomain down to the browser extension via websockets, and then the browser extension makes the request to your local server and sends the response back up.

Happy to share more details if you're interested.
First you need a database of postcodes to geographic coordinates. The Office of National Statistics publish a postcode database on [their data portal](https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/) - just search for "ONS Postcode" and look for the latest one - they update it about once every 3 months.

Ignore the Northings and Eastings (OSGB36) and use the Lat/Lng (WGS84) coordinates.

Next you need the [Haversine Formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula) - this is a formula for determining if a given point is within the radius of another point on a globe (eg. Earth). You can probably find either a library for this for whatever language you're working in, or a version for your language on Stack Overflow / Google.

Side note:
If you're looking to match users full addresses, not just the postcode, the only fully up-to-date database I'm aware of is the [Royal Mail PAF](http://www.poweredbypaf.com/) - unfortunately this costs quite a bit of money (unless you're a charity or some other exceptions)

This makes me curious - how much of Edge is open source?

If all of it were, I guess someone could try to backport it to windows 7 ( depending on dependencies).
It says that you can embed the engine in your app. Can someone ELI5 why you would need/want that. I have only built things for browsers which have their own engine, and I assume that if you are making an app for Windows, it would use the engine on the OS. What am i missing?
Just when I think Microsoft couldn't get any more edgy they go and name a thing after a yoga move.
[deleted]
Pretty much just Chakra Core at this point. Hopefully more in the future.

Backporting to Windows 7 would be nearly impossible since the UI is built as a Windows Universal App which is not supported in Windows 7 or 8
More useful for Windows IoT scenarios where there is no browser.
haha.  Chakra has been around since the days of IE9.
It's actually an Indian god's weapon. The 'Vishnu Charkra'.

Perks of having an Indian CEO I guess.
Eh, Edge is not IE and they are abandoning most of their major IE versions so I doubt they are trying to make things work for IE.
I love that. Their "universal" apps don't work on the last two versions of their OS.
Chakra has been used since Internet Explorer 9, which has been released 5 years ago, far before Nadella became a CEO.
Especially considering the fact that it works pretty much like electron (html/css/js for ui). 
Ahh, didn't know that.
That's only one of options, and even not the most popular one.
not bootstrap related (feel free to downvote) but it's amazing how "[passÃ©](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/pass%C3%A9)" made its way to the English dictionnary while "[has-been](http://www.larousse.fr/dictionnaires/francais/_has_been/39168)" made its way to the French dictionnary.

No, for what purpose are you asking? There are sites where I wouldn't suggest using it, and sites where one should - and a lot depends on how much customization you need.

If you're asking is it dying, and has the entire community decided on something else, definitely not.
In some circles, but the fact is that a well-tested grid with a lot of out-of-the-box functionality and active community gets projects going quickly and efficiently. The problem is when you don't add any customization and it LOOKS like Bootstrap, but this isn't the fault of Bootstrap as much as it is the laziness of a dev or designer in making a design their own.
Passe? Not so much. But the best tool for the job... I don't know. There's an awful lot of bloat. Great functionality, but it's big. Also, the "div-itus" is an issue, from a semantic/accessibility perspective.

Don't get me wrong, I like bootstrap, and I do a lot of development with it, but sometimes I think it's overkill and making us lazy.  
No
Every other website is using bootstrap these days, so yes, it is very common and doesn't please some developers. But as a user, they can hardly tell that a site uses bootstrap or not. Alpha 4 and introduction of card layout will make it interesting though.
It does seem to me that a lot of sites using bootstrap look basically the same. It doesn't have to be that way, but I see a lot of usage of templates with minimal adaption. 
You don't need full flown Sql Sever. Install Visual Studio Community (which is free) and you'll get everything you need including localdb, a small database that works well for small applications. If you end up needing sql server, just get sql server express (for testing).

In addition, I would considering getting ReSharper (not free, but you can get a free trial). other than that mostly everything comes out of the box. Get familiar with NuGet (.net package manager) and you can start bringing in open source packages to your app. 

In terms of web dev, you need to learn ASP.NET (the webstack used for .net applications). There are a few flavors of asp.net:

* ASP.NET MVC. Modular MVC framework similar to rails, learn this. It's what most people are migrating to or starting new applications in.

* ASP.NET WebForms. Older technology that tries to make web dev feel like desktop development. You can drag a button, double click it and write code to fire when clicked. Conceptually it's pretty cool, but it's not web dev it's something on top of it. Most people are moving away from this.

The official site has a lot of really good resources, including tutorials and videos http://www.asp.net/mvc
`apt install nginx php7.0 php7.0-mysql mariadb-server` should do the work. *Don't take this seriously* 
Thanks for the answer.
I am not new to .NET as I have been working on it for 3 years. The thing is I never developed for myself, meaning that I always used whatever environment was given by the companies I worked at. This meant having licenses for VS Ultimate, Windows Server Virtual Machines, Team Foundation and so on....

I wanted to get some information on how to setup for some private and personal coding :)
If you're using Underscores, then you're probably creating your own design. In that case, if you know how to make a "mobile-first" responsive design, it shouldn't have anything to do with the theme or WordPress, but with the design you create.

LESS and Sass have nothing to do with it, they're just preprocessors that make writing CSS easier/more organized. 

If you like Underscores and don't know how to make your own custom responsive design, you can look into [_strap](https://github.com/ptbello/_strap), a Bootstrap port of Underscores. Bootstrap is already responsive/mobile first. 
Thanks for the reply, I understand the process and I am looking to create my own design, I know I can design it mobile first but when I have underscores all ready to go it has a giant CSS file I work in and none of that works intuitively with mobile first. I feel like it is set up to add media queries after the fact.. if that makes any sense. Im still learning and trying to do it the right way so this maybe I am thinking of it wrong.
Are you using `min-width` media queries? [Here's a quick article](http://www.taniarascia.com/you-dont-need-a-framework/) I wrote about the fundamentals of responsive design.

It's hard to give you much input without seeing what you already know. Underscores works with Sass, but you can also just override the CSS stylesheet they have the old fashioned way. ([Understanding Sass](http://www.taniarascia.com/learn-sass-now/), if you're interested.)
I'll read both articles. Appreciate it.

The best conference I've ever attended is OSCON, which is a conference about open-source technologies. The conference is on a range of topics including front end technologies, big data, security, backend, etc. What's nice about the conference is that it's huge and has so many different types of talks. There are also some big companies like Netflix and Salesforce that give presentations on how they use open source technologies.

If you're using Redux, then state is only changed in a reducer. Here's a good intro for [Redux](https://egghead.io/series/getting-started-with-redux).
For, me that is the big turn down everytime I learn about a new one.

The boundaries and principles of use can easily be changed if the user wants to. Essentially they do the same thing and you will get to a point where you will have to subvert the original principles in order to use the framework instead of being used by it... They all seem cool on paper, but when using them... It all comes down to your own way of doing things.
In Ember and Angular, you mutate state directly from anywhere.

In Redux, you only emit actions from anywhere that trigger a state change in a central transactor. One of the chief goals of this abstraction is to avoid the problems that come with unrestricted state mutation from anywhere. For example, now you have a central place to reason about the question of "did something change?"
Yeah, but you can call that reducer from anywhere. In TJ's example, he passes that function to 3 different places, but only chooses to call it in one.
Well, the point of baking opinion into an abstraction (like Redux) is so that you don't really have a choice in the matter, and doing the wrong/bad thing will stand out like a sore thumb. Though I agree that choosing a framework involves a level of agreeing with that opinion.

That said, the React/Flux landscape is pretty overwhelming and a chore to flip through. I tried pretty much every Flux implementation and didn't like any of them until I tried Redux. I highly recommend giving Redux a shot. It's basically the same abstraction people are using in Clojurescript and Elm to handle complexity.
You never call the reducer directly, you pass it to the store and then call `store.dispatch({action})`. 

What function is he passing around and not calling? I'm a bit tired and can't exactly tell what you mean.
Dispatching an action from anywhere is a far cry from mutating state from anywhere. The former is an abstraction that precisely addresses the problems of the latter.

The reason why he encapsulates the dispatch in a function is so that downstream components don't need to know about stores and actions - instead they just call a function. That's just dependency management, and it's hard to appreciate in such a small app.
TodoActions are available in 3 separate files, the bottom most component "TodoTextInput" is where he chooses to call the reducer. Which is just a preference for "Data Down, Actions Up". Nothings actually stopping him from shooting himself in foot and calling it sooner.
isn't it just the same as

    var foo = {
      _state = false
      get state(){return this.state}
      set state(val){return this.state = val}
    }

I'm obviously pretending you can't do foo._state = bar

It can now only be called by the exposed methods, but anything can use your setter. You're not doing a duck typing "Only things of type XYZ can call my magic function". Unless you're saying by having to call dispatch first, that's what you're doing.
It's the difference between calling `db.query('SELECT * FROM users')` and `db.getUsers()` in every file: if that query ever changes, you now just have to update it in one place.

But notice that this is solving a different problem than mutating state from anywhere.

Repeating yourself in code isn't really shooting yourself in the foot the same way you are when you can't reason about your application's behavior because you mutate code everywhere. The latter is the root cause of complexity in every application while the former typically amounts to an inconvenience.
No, it's much different than simple assignment. 

You have to flush changes to the DOM using an expensive API. You have to know when you need to re-render, what you need to re-render, and if you need to re-render. You also need to batch state changes together in one render. You have to manage other side-effects like AJAX calls and animations. And this all needs to be performant, easy to reason about, and encapsulated in a API that lets people handle these complexities. 

These are the problems that client-side frameworks are trying to solve with increasingly better ideas.

For example,`updateState(n => n + 1)` isn't just sugar for `state.n = f(state.n)`. One thing it does is push the state change into a queue so that it can batch multiple state changes into a single render, and it handles all that for you including the ultimate DOM flush if there even needs to be one at all.
`Object.assign` is convenient and built-in. That's the benefit. But it's really basic and only supports objects. It's just a merge. It also gets bulky pretty quickly once you start managing a lot of state or doing deeper modifications. It depends on ES6 syntax to be convenient (`Object.assign({}, state, { todos: [ ...state.todos, { text: action.text } ] })`).

Immutable.js gives you a lot. It gives you a new data structures like Sets and OrderedMaps. It works with arrays (Lists). It has a rich API for managing data in them. It's also more performant since it uses persistent data structures so reduce copying.

For managing state in Redux, I recommend Immutable since it'll vastly improve your code and the API will serve you well. Redux's tutorials/docs use `Object.assign` and I think that was a good idea for the documentation and the examples. He wants to make the point that the data needs to be immutable rather than the library depends on Immutable.

Here's a simple example of the sort of code that Immutable lets you write:

    var data1 = Immutable.fromJS({
      things: [1, 2, 3],
      user: {
        uname: 'Kerry',
        score: 42
      }

    // Inc user's score
    var data2 = data1.updateIn(['user', 'score'], n => n + 1);

I'd love to have its API in run of the mill Javascript code. :)

State management is just one of those things where it's worthwhile to bring in a library like Immutable.
If it is only you working on the project and you trust yourself to never accidentally mutate data, the Object.assign() approach is just fine (and obviously the lighter option), but on large projects with many developers, Immuable.js forces the convention of immutable structures. With redux, all of the state changes are in the reducers so tracking incorrect mutations tends to be easier, but I find forcing immutability with Immutable.js to be the better option in the long run. yrmv
Any advantage to using ImmutableJS over ES6 const?
Awesome answer. Thanks.
Great, thanks for the feedback.
Glad to answer. The new variable declaration const, adheres to the same block scoping principles as let, but const implies that the value are not going to mutate. However, there is a caveat. 

    // Value will still be assigned to 'foo'
    const value = 'foo';
    value = 'bar';

You are unable to change the value, but that's not true of objects or arrays, but they will always maintain their reference to that object or array.
    
    // Name value will change
    const person = {
        name: 'Darth'
    }

    person.name = 'Vader';

Immutable.js is used so a developer can't just mutate their data directly like that. Instead, it changes it's reference to another object(or value as it's called in Immutable.js) to have an updated or new value.

So, what can be said about this is that const remains immutable only for primitive data types: String, Number, Boolean, Null, and Undefined.
Const provides an immutable reference, but you are free to mutate  the object in place just like any another object. Immutable.js actually returns a new copy when you change it (although that explanation is simplified as Immutable js uses structural sharing to remain performant.)
Ah, that makes a lot of sense.  Thanks for your response.
There is no way big enterprise are going to upgrade just like that. I know some companies still on IE 6 it's an absolute shambles 
You seem to be confusing Microsoft not supporting it with people not using it...
They seemingly just renamed it Edge. I mean sites are still totally borked in it compared to almost every other browser. 
Really? I used it while it was called Project Spartan and everything worked perfectly fine. Was there a couple months worth of regressions pushed to production builds?

Am I the only one who finds it hard to code with music on? If it's HTML or CSS then I like music but if I'm doing some non trivial JavaScript or php or something then I really need quiet to get my head around the problem.
[deleted]
/r/chillstep
Huge hiphop head and rapper here, but I often won't listen to it while coding because I get too into it. 
  
I usually do classical to focus and get stuff done, then hiphop/dubsteb to get jacked up if I'm feeling sleepy :).
Final Fantasy orchestrations or indie rock.
Over the past couple of years I've put together a massive playlist of deep beats with lots of long mixes.  Recommend checking it out: https://soundcloud.com/erik-trautman-1/sets/coding-working-beats
Boards of Canada, Aphex Twin, Burial, Four Tet. Gets me locked into the code zone every time.

tenacious d and lindsey stirling.
I have a R&B/Soul Pandora playlist that I've been cultivating since like 2010.
Death grips, Brian eno, tangerines dream, and Jack Johnson
Tycho
Same as when I'm not coding - mainly symphonic/power metal
Jazzandrain.com
If I really want to concentrate I stick to Carbon based lifeforms, movie soundtracks or http://www.noisli.com/
The Age of Empires II soundtrack us amazing 
Steve Reich - Music for 18 Musicians. 
Philip Glass Ensemble - Music in Twelve Parts
Deep Focus on spotify. 
Progressive metal/rock
Post Rock, Electronic and Metal are the genres I use. 

I've slowly been building a playlist of this stuff the last few months since I started my new job. 

[My Spotify Playlist for those interested!](https://open.spotify.com/user/cr0ssvtw/playlist/2VkRuVMyEzyHvuU5nS4P9u)
Vitamin String Quartet when coding

If some code is messed up, Slayer.
Mostly Boards of Canada. Sometimes Aphex Twin or progressive rock.
Godspeed You! Black Emperor - Slow Riot for New ZerÃ¸ Kanada 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c9TyeKnGGk
My coding mixes typically consist of Autechre, M83, James Blake, CHROMATICS, Grimes, and Blur.
When I really need to get shit done, it's gotta be [Crystal Method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_EbkSMPbj_I).

For my day to day, I have a playlist with a mix of [trance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04Uuarao5hM), [dubstep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssQn04okPLU), and [breakbeat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4JVOwODt_I).

If they start too slow for you, skip to about 12-15mins in.
DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince - Boom! Shake the Room
Sufjan Stevens or Morrissey/The Smiths always work for me
Austrian Death Machine!
Usually cue up Pandora stations seeded with Meat Loaf, Queen, or Vitamin String Quartet.
[Tabletop Audio](http://tabletopaudio.com/) was designed for another purpose, but I enjoy coding to it as well.
Really chill / hard trap music. Maybe I'm weird like that
I listen to comedy specials while coding. Most often they are specials that I have listened to before so there isn't too much of a surprise. 
Anything from Taylor swift to dubstep. I have made the same thread actually, interesting responses. 
Spotify all the way, usually what's on today suggestions.
Dave Matthews Band. Their live stuff has a lot of variety and the songs/albums are quite long which is great for long coding sessions.
Any techno, dubstep, trip-hop and if all else fails I fire up some Tool.
I listen mostly when there are distractions at home. I have this list bookmarked http://imgur.com/gallery/y9qP8

I've been listening to a good chunk of Future Funk tracks in the last days. Works quite good, especially with the slower, more lo-fi songs. 

Here's a good example: [VECTOR GRAPHICS - DESTINE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYQrPsyu-1s) 

Check out the channel, they have over 600 songs!
This is a recent addition for me, but I'm a big fan of the Golden Sun series (1 & 2 anyway), and this guy did fully-orchestrated remixes of a bunch of the songs, and I've been enjoying them a lot as a work playlist.

Most of the time brain.fm sometimes my [coding playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/1121772134/playlist/3DIT2r1P6NA15JlbRmXAG0) on spotify
Usually IDM or Jazz (favourites are [Boards of Canada](https://open.spotify.com/track/47wSsypqjVoZ7XaGIp1aOV) and [BadBadNotGood](https://open.spotify.com/track/2e0OFMXTJCKhlP7QiqBM3R)), but sometimes I just put on some [white noise](http://mynoise.net/NoiseMachines/whiteNoiseGenerator.php).
- joji music (http://soundcloud.com/chloeburbank)
- rainy day triphop
- generationals
I started a collaborative Spotify playlist with some dudes from work and it's all hiphop and electronic. Granted, there's only 80 songs on it right now.. it's kind of new and I'm the only person contributing anymore. 
Deep House: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vHRUsP20dQ

That's my favorite. Throw on some headphones, get coding, and I feel like I'm taking prescription ADD drugs.
I really like handpan music. It's got no words, it's gentle and mysterious sounding.
Used to listen to a lot of hyper energetic Deathcore type music but lately I've been putting on a lot of post rock/prog metal stuff. Cloudkicker, Anup Sastry and Russian Circles are my favs right now.
I find chill 90s hip hop grooves gets me my most productive. Here's my goto albums.

A tribe called quest - Midnight Marauders/low end theory
Pharacyde - Bizarre Ride II
Beastie Boys - Hello Nasty
Wu Tang - 36 Chambers
Daft punk - Homework
Gorrilaz - Demon Dayz
Instrumentals of the above.
I listen to a broad range of genres, but while coding I prefer instrumental music. Depending on how much noise I am trying to shut out it varies from Nils Frahm to Russian Circles. 
Gigi D'Agostino.

Come to think of it I've listened to his stuff for years. He goes under a few pseudonyms for some other genres he covered.
Trap music, for instance Baauer, Flosstrodsmus, RL Grime. I like chill hip hop beats too, but too much of that stuff leaves me unmotivated. 

Occasionally Drum and Bass, especially when I'm depressed. 
Video game soundtracks!

I like ambient, electronic, and IDM music. Somafm provide a nice balance for this. Especially these two radio stations:

- https://somafm.com/missioncontrol/
- http://somafm.com/cliqhop/
Emancipator
Usually old trip-hop when I'm coding.. Hooverphonic, Massive Attack, Tricky, Portishead, stuff like that. 

Funnily enough it's not something I'd usually listen to, but I find I can still concentrate with it playing in the background. I struggle coding listening to the hardcore/post hardcore I normally listen to :p
It really depends on the day. Some days I like metal because it gives me energy. Other days I prefer electronic music like Dubstep or House, because it's a different kind of energy. Like motivational energy. Then rap other days because it reminds me that my efforts are going to make me $$$$ ;)
C418 - Minecraft/Alpha :)
If I don't have to focus too hard, metal with vocals in it. If I really need to crunch down though, I'll listen to more instrumental stuff, like Animals as Leaders, Conquering Dystopia, or Blotted Science. I need the instrumental stuff now because I used to listen to metal as background music, but after long enough I've gotten to where I can understand the vocals, and I can't really concentrate with them. 
I have a spotify playlist of the entire Lord of the Rings soundtrack played in order. I rarely get tired of it.
google music always and forever. musicforprogramming.net is awesome 2.
Usually this playlist https://open.spotify.com/user/1119302122/playlist/4FfkDzZqv2q0bsqwfo3VWK but sometimes other playlists on my spotify, then occasionally ill dip into mixes on soundcloud/mixcloud
Tycho
Grammatik
Fluified channel on youtube has good mixes.
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTPjZ7UC8NgcZI8UKzb3rLw
I listen to a lot of electronic, I have a huge Spotify playlist I'm tweaking for my needs.

https://open.spotify.com/user/gabesimmer/playlist/2fM6oTltFyh48wcLrFcVcV for those interested.

I don't actually have an exclusive playlist for programming. I listen to pretty much the same bands/singers I would listen in other occasions. But I do tend to listen to more techno-ish songs. For example, whenever I feel like I'm losing my motivation, I just play [this song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThFnvjYYtFw) and I get pumped again.
Lately, it's been a little bit of cyberpunk: https://lazerhawk.bandcamp.com/album/redline
Pink Floyd, Dire Straits, rhcp, beatles, clapton, SRV, led zeppelin for me
Game Day Bass Drop station on Pandora
Anything which can be described as, either â€œminimalist, non-rhythmic ambient,â€ or â€œâ€˜easy listeningâ€™ phonography.â€

I suppose the catch-all of â€œbackground noiseâ€ also suffices.
Basically stuff with no words in it - ambient, minimal techno, instrumental music etc.

I really like The Sight Below - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6be18GacTs
If I'm up against a deadline, I really like exotica/lounge/easy listening - stuff like Martin Denny, Les Baxter etc. It's energetic but also a bit silly so it keeps me in a good mood. Otherwise it's whatever I'm in the mood for - usually industrial, noise, ebm, electro, italo, techno, synthpop, dub, krautrock or something.
Usually [metal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYaxAosBuro) or [synthwave](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVf7NBncUy0) for me.
Yo Yo Ma, anything classical or EDM
That's not weird! I could listen to rain whilst doing just about anything and i'm sure it'll make it better
Love rainymood!
www.Asoftmurmur.com is great too.
http://www.noisli.com/ is also a good background noise generator. You can select different kinds of noise, how loud or intense they are, or just use the random or preset options!
I now have to run to the bathroom every 15 minutes :(((
Dude! That's awesome, I love rainymood.com. I listen to rain and throw on some Andy McKee. Definitely gonna check out Lush.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPoqNeR3_UA isn't bad either.

Thats half the reason I created http://kakapo.co
Listening to rain isn't enough.  Nothing makes me concentrate more than actual rain.
Pretty Lights represent
Love Nujabes!
[Feather](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfFTT3iz740) is just something out of this world.
Pretty much described most of my programming playlist.

I'd also add Clams Casino (mellow electronic) and Explosions in the Sky (Post rock)
Tycho fan for 15 years 
Looks cool, is there any affiliate codes? I'm planning on signing up
 Wow this is awesome, currently using it now in 'Focus' mode set to 2 hours. 
Same here. Lots of different channels and not having to pick out tracks or playlists is really nice.
Digitally Imported is fantastic, no DJs and minimal ads on the free access. I'm a fan of the Classic EuroDance and Hardcore channels for coding - but there is so much choice to switch around if it gets boring.

Tip: If you have a premium account your login will also work for RockRadio and RadioTunes. The latter has a show tunes channel!
I pretty much always code while listening to music, UNTIL I get stuck on something. Then it immediately becomes an irritation and I turn it off until the problem is solved. 
Yea I get like that too sometimes.
You are not alone! I love music, and even write and play it, but it is insanely distracting for me when I'm doing anything besides trivial design work. I need a quiet space to get serious work done.
I find non-intrusive music (Tycho or Bonobo being great examples) helps me a lot because it drowns out the ambient noise of the office.

I really can't get any work done without music. It's weird not having music for me, I'm usually listening to music for literally 12 hours a day.

Free coffee and music are basically my fuel.
Is this the one you mean? 

http://songza.com/listen/code-your-face-off-songza/
Listening to Emancipator right now :)

I'd add Carbon Based Lifeforms to your list.
http://plyl.st/chillstep lets you toggle specific artists/tags and re-order the tracks by dragging them. It has a bunch of glitches, but I am hoping to start work on it again.
Awesome.  Do you have any tracks we can listen too? I would love to hear a rap about web development.

edit: Are you this guy? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnSJBpB_OKQ
I listen to rap when I need to bang out some code that I really wish I didn't have to do.
Actually. Wow. That's the exact same thing for me
Now I have to listen to the FFX soundtrack at work today 
sickk, exactly what i was looking for in the thread, ty
programming is very much a repetitive act, especially on front end web development

you use a lot of the same functions/methods over and over again. basically, so repetitive music helps us get our rhythm going and it can really put you in the zone
something to do w/ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainwave_entrainment

I have some mp3s of some kind of dance music that really helps me concentrate.  I was working in an office one day with 2-3 super adhd people.  We were getting nothing done.  I put one of the tracks on the stereo and watched. It was like I dosed them with aural Ritalin.  Mozart piano music really works for me too.
hah. i like your taste.

Have you listened to Sync24? It's a CBL side project. 
I can't code to that album, but it IS one of the greatest recordings of music ever.
This album is a fucking masterpiece
I can really feel the "I gotta get this done" in Crystal Method. Cool.
I have no idea how you can listen to dubstep while coding! Then again I'm not a big dubstep fan
Same here, although if I'm just plugging away on something not too difficult its normally mainstream hard rock/metal, anything that gets my head nodding. 
RainyMood + Music is great.
Don't think so.

There is a unique invite link that you get to invite friends, but so far I don't think it provides any kind of incentive for you or the person joining via your link.

My only complaint is that the progressive channel, my favorite, does have a DJ talking for about a minute on either end of the track, but fortunately each track is about an hour long so it's not that frequent.
Yeah, if I am in a noisy place then it's definitely the lesser of two evils.
Haha sadly no, I am not the Page Rank rapper. Here's my latest solo EP, not coding related whatsoever:

A few bands I discovered this (last) year: Reign of Kindo, Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds, Andrew McMahon in the Wilderness, Wolftron, Electric Youth, St Lucia, Jukebox the Ghost, Nightmare of You, The Colourist. 

Apple Music has a bunch of Distant Worlds and people's attempts at remastering Nobuo's OSTs.
Nothing like 'guillotine' when fixing production issues.
Just checked out Sync24, sounds very similar, thanks for the recommendation!
I generally ignore the words and try to type in rhythm to the music. Sometimes you just get into a groove. I'm not huge into it either but I really dig these two tracks specifically. Also old prodigy (zeds dead has a sick remix of breathe - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plLaK4QWKdE).

I'm way more into something like Alice in chains or Metallica but it's too distracting to code to. I have a habit of breaking out into spontaneous head banging / air guitar.
I now feel like i'm coding at home on a wet sunday morning.
Whoa that was nice! Awesome man!
I'll check those out!! You ever listen to the shadow of the colossus soundtrack?  It's great
Haha word thanks for checking it out! Fun hobby when I'm tired of coding :P
Nope, but I'll check it out now. Thanks!
Reminds me of a question I asked wolframalpha when I was trying to visualize how many IP v6 addresses there *actually* are.

Answer: Enough for every grain of sand on the planet to have several billions each. Or trillions if you're American. It baffles me that we can't even agree on what those words mean. Anyways, there are lots of IP addresses, and we probably won't run out anytime soon.

Source: http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2%5E128+%2F+number+of+grains+of+sand+on+earth
I keep forgetting this exists and then stumbling on it again.  Then I tend to black out and I find myself waking up in a pile of graph paper.  Beats Googling yourself though.
[Try "Chances of winning the powerball lottery" for the real odds](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=chances+of+winning+the+powerball+lottery)
This applies to almost any odds
Where "fascinating algorithm" is probably someone typing it in.
Funny.. But if I just google it, I get the exact answer I expected. 

Given how popular the powerball is right now in my location, it's a pretty safe assumption that's what I want to see the odds for.
Aw. I was hoping that answer was what Wolfram Alpha said.
> Enough for every grain of sand on the planet to have several billions each. Or trillions if you're American. It baffles me that we can't even agree on what those words mean. 

What do you mean? There is a global disagreement about how many zeroes are in a billion or trillion?
Here is the explanation I was given in college, which I like a lot.

Imagine some future where Earth's population reaches one trillion and every single person has a personal nanobot cloud of one trillion bots. Now imagine one trillion planets each with the same population and number of nanobots. A unique address could be assigned to each of these bots using less than 1% of IPv6's address space.
Now that's something I never even knew about!
Nah nothing's better than [Googling yourself](https://imgur.com/gallery/5NPh0).
Wolfram isn't trying to be Google, they serve different purposes. 
Well wolfram doesn't mine data about you, so they can't exactly give personalized results.
Sorry about that. They're welcome to use it, though. Paging Stephen Wolfram?
In British English, a billion used to be equivalent to a million million (i.e. 1,000,000,000,000), while in American English it has always equated to a thousand million (i.e. 1,000,000,000). British English has now adopted the American figure, though, so that a billion equals a thousand million in both varieties of English.

https://www.oxforddictionaries.com/words/how-many-is-a-billion
[Yes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_and_short_scales)
I know that in German they use billion to mean a million million.

They use Milliarde for the billion equivalent
There is quite a lot of overlap. Including this question.

Wolfram should be trying to be more like Google, because google is definitely going to try to be more like wolfram.
Not according to Microsoft with their search which integrates their service unless something has changed
be careful, he may claim it's his
Huh, TIL.  What did the Brits call 1,000,000,000 before?  A thousand million?
Then you start wondering how much a billion [barrels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrel_\(unit\)) of something is and realize you're really screwed.
Thanks for sharing. So basically it's not a problem anymore except in languages other than English? Doesn't that make it not a problem at all? If you're speaking English, it is known that you are using the shortscale.
This is the first I've heard of this. 
Same in Swedish.  

Tusen = 1000  
Miljon = 1000 x tusen  
Miljard = 1000 x miljon
Biljon = 1000 x miljard

Ã„n endless source of hilarious but stupid misunderstandings. 
I hate it when I find myself agreeing with both sides of an argument.
Wolfram has a target market and they're sticking to it. There are a lot of advantages in catering towards a given market, especially when you'd be directly competing with a companys size of Google and Microsoft if you expanded.

Google's target market is basically everything, general information. They will often be at a disadvantage to players who focus solely on a tiny portion of it. 

It's definitely possible Google might put Wolfram out of business one day. But I don't think the appropriate response to that is for Wolfram to stretch their resources even thinner. IMO they should just double down on science and academia, and not worry about things like location aware searches and user data mining. Those are seldom going to be useful to their target audience. 

$.02 
A thmillion. 
The brits are capable of using several multisyllabic words in a row.

Just remember where "bae" came from.... 
One thousand million
It's a bit inconvenient when the words are similar in English and the other language, like it is in Swedish, especially when switching between languages often.

In English it goes like million, billion, trillion, while in Swedish it's miljon, miljard, biljon, biljard, triljon. You might not be aware of the longscale/shortscale thing since English isn't your main language, and it would be easy to mix up if you aren't thinking.
It's really more of a Europe/America thing. In Europe, long scale is mostly used (~~in both english~~ and other languages). In America, short scale is mostly used.

Gets really confusing ([danish vs. american](https://da.wikipedia.org/wiki/Store_tal)):

Danish|American|Scientific
---|---|---
million|million|10^6
milliard|billion|10^9
billion|trillion|10^12
billiard|quadrillion|10^15
trillion|quintillion|10^18
trilliard|sextillion|10^21
> double down on science and academia

Then they should ease up on the "funny" messages that don't actually answer your question and instead prompt people for the variables it needs to answer the question. Or suggest naming a specific lottery so that it can provide the answer.
Same in German: Millionen Milliarden Billionen Billiarden Trillionen... 
But the only English speaking countries in Europe use the short scale. 
South America exists.
Unlike most things, I actually prefer the American version of these. 
Now. I guess the US won the only "unit war" worth winning, because they for sure won't win the "imperal vs metric war".
Not sure if you got downvoted because someone disagrees or because someone thinks South America isn't relevant...
Which does it use?
Long-scale. 
Not really..
What are some quarterly key metrics you measure for yourself and your team? You could start there. Jot down a few metrics, set a goal to improve those by a certain realistic percentage points by the end of the quarter, and jot down a few concrete steps you can take under each metrics to improve it.

If you have a super long list of metrics, prioritize them based on **revenue**. What of your responsibilities affects the bottom-line the most?
That's quite a clever move for them. The two markets line up perfectly. 

And I was really impressed with their 'challenge' service when I had to do a challenge
funny I made something very similar a few days ago

When you're back-tracking through code, and you see a method you're unfamiliar with, click it and hit F12 - it will take you to where it was declared. Very helpful.

I believe this also works with variables. 
Install [BundlerMinifier](https://github.com/madskristensen/BundlerMinifier) to bundle and minify CSS and JS files.

Install [CodeMaid](http://www.codemaid.net/) for simple code cleanup things that will help you write cleaner code over time.

Install [Refactoring Essentials](http://vsrefactoringessentials.com/) to simplify refactoring. (VS includes some tools for automated refactoring but this is much more powerful).

Install [Web Essentials](http://vswebessentials.com/) which provides a ton of handy features for web development.  (This has bundling built in, but I like the above linked addon better).

Finally, full Visual Studio 2015 includes a lot of crap you probably don't want (I'm looking at you windows phone / azure SDKs and tools!), so grab [Total Uninstaller](https://github.com/tsasioglu/Total-Uninstaller) to get rid of whatever you don't want the easy way.



Alt+Shift+Up/Down will highlight the same point on more then one line, useful for doing the same to multiple lines of code such as adding a comma to same length strings to turn into an array
In terms of functionality, I'm with you: the software is so full-featured, you're kind of forced to discover features as you need them. However, a couple things that made my experience a lot better:

Install [this](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/1b0d7360-40dd-447e-8bef-90e2cf52f683) reboot of RockScroll, it turns the scrollbar on the right side into a preview of the active document, with little glyphs for bookmarks and breakpoints, and accurately reflecting the shape and color of text blocks (e.g., large blocks of commented code). Also, with it installed, double clicking on any word will highlight all occurrences of that word throughout the document in the text and in the margin. Soooo useful.

Use a dark theme. It's easier on the eyes. I think 2015 comes with one bundled.

edit: oh, we're doing keyboard shortcuts. There are some multi-key shortcuts where you hold ctrl while pressing two keys in sequence. K+D will auto-format the current document with indentation for loops and the like. K+C will comment out the currently highlighted text, and K+U will uncomment it.
What version of VS 2015 are you using? Enterprise has a lot more options and features than other tiers for example. I'm going to assume enterprise is the feature set that you have access to. Similarly what type of app are you building? I'm assuming standard web app considering where you posted. But if you're doing Unity or something the list would be different:

* CodeMaid, Refactoring Essentials, and Web Essentials are pretty much the go to extensions at the moment (and/or ReSharper but I'm cheap).

* I recommend learning the [shortcuts](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/da5kh0wa.aspx). The most useful ones are usually F5, F10, F11, etc. Basically the debug ones. Ctrl+N (new file), the refactor ones come in handy (Ctrl+R, Ctrl+M), etc. F12 will show you where an item is declared, Shift+F12 will show you all references of the object, etc.

* Ctrl+. That's Ctrl and the period key. Learn it. Especially if you install refactoring essentials. If you're on a line of code and you see a light bulb to the left, hit that key combo and it brings up a bunch of suggestions and fixes for your code.

Features built into the product:
* The analyze tab at the top has two options that are useful. The first is "Run Code Analysis" and the other is "Calculate Code Metrics". Potentially useful when searching for code that needs improvement.

* Testing. First, if you have unit tests learn your way around the Test Explorer. You can set it up to automatically run the tests after each build if you want, can change the view, etc. You will find under the Test dropdown that there is an option called "Analyze Code Coverage". Good way to find out if you have decent set of unit tests or not. Also you can right click on a class and have two options. One is "Create Unit Tests". This will automatically create basic scaffolding for unit tests for the class. By default it only does MSTest but you can find extensions for other frameworks. The other option of note is "Create Intellitest". This is new in VS 2015. Basically it will generate tests for your code based on a series of not quite random input values. So they're not quite unit tests and they're not great without asserts, etc. in your code but they do find a lot of the null reference, ArgumentOutOfRange, etc. exceptions.

* [Intellitrace](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd264915.aspx). I will admit that it's overkill for me but depending upon your setup, what you're building, etc. It will save you a lot of time.

* When debugging, you can use the Diagnostic Tools view. This will show you memory, CPU usage, etc. Can be quite useful.

* Gulp, Grunt, etc. support is built in now. If you want you can set up a Gulp file on a project's directory and set it to run. You just need to open the "Task Runner Explorer" and you can even set it to run specific tasks at certain times (Before Build, After Build, Clean, and Project Open).

There's a ton of other features but those are the ones I can think of off the top of my head.
Ctrl - (Ctrl + "minus") moves you back through all of the places you've been in through code files, and Ctrl+Shift - will move you forward again
http://visualstudioshortcuts.com/2015/
I hardly use the mouse when I'm in development mode, which helps me keep an uninterrupted flow. 

Not so much Visual Studio specific, but https://www.dotnetrocks.com/ podcasts are really entertaining. I've learned a ton by listening during my commute. A lot of the interviewees are ms employees who developed feature sets.
> I believe this also works with variables.

It does.
This *is* handy and also applies in SSMS.
> I think 2015 comes with one bundled

It does.
We're on VS Professional, MVC project. I'll clarify that in the OP.

I've honestly never used tests. I used them in college, but I've never grasped the concept of how to use a unit test in an MVC project. I'm sure that sounds really dumb, but... yeah. 

The rest of this is awesome, I've read through it and it'll be very helpful. Thanks a ton!
It does not work with chrome dev tools :( im so used to f12-ing to a function that i do it in dev tools and it closes it. :(
If you're on Pro, IntelliTrace, code coverage, performance testing, etc. are missing. CodeLens is there though. Forgot to mention that. As far as unit testing an MVC app... It depends on your app's architecture as to how easy it is. Anything that is the model or controller layer should be fairly easy to test. And you can test those parts usually the same way that you test any other code. Views are usually where things get weird though. Especially now that most apps are just a static page plus a ton of javascript and REST calls... It gets weird sometimes is what I'm getting at. But if you want to start down that path, [this](http://www.asp.net/mvc/overview/older-versions-1/unit-testing/creating-unit-tests-for-asp-net-mvc-applications-cs) might be helpful. There are a ton of other tutorials that give you a basic overview but I have to go and feed a toddler breakfast so I'll leave you to search for them. :)
For an image to retain its aspect ratio by default, it needs `height: auto;` (if you have a set width). This means that the images have to be the same aspect ratio for them to be identical in size.

If you want them to be identical in size but the source images have different aspect ratios, you have a couple of options. The easiest is to ditch the image tags and use background-image on a div instead. Then you can set any size you want for that div and set `background-size: cover` (the image will be scaled large enough to cover the entire div while retaining aspect ratio) or `background-size: contain` (the image will be scaled just so it fits into the container, and there will be an empty space on the sides).

You can use the same technique on an image element using `object-fit: cover` (or contain), but that is still not as widely supported, so you might need a polyfill. 
I feel the same
I plan on doing [this udacity course on responsive images](https://www.udacity.com/wiki/ud882) sometime soon.
This article uses videos as an example, but works fine for images too: http://alistapart.com/article/creating-intrinsic-ratios-for-video.
    img {
        max-width: 100%;
        height: auto;
    }
Another option would be to give your images a class, and then set the appropriate height/width for each viewport in media queries. And if you were working with just a singular image, like a large home page image, you could just set the height to auto. 
If you use Bootstrap, you can just add the class "img-responsive" to the images you want to be responsive and they'll shrink based on the containers that they are within.
    img{
        max-width: 100%;
    }
Works like a charm

Thanks for the tip. I never thought of using background-image. I will give this a try and see how it goes. Thanks!
Also would making images the same size via a third party program like photoshop help make the photos look better at all?
Not a bad idea. I have read about the new HTML5 picture element, but I am not sure if I should use that since IE and Safari don't support it yet. 
Right I know this is the default for doing this. However id I do this, than all my images are different sizes. I want them all the same exact size. 
The downside of using background images is that a div doesn't have an alt tag.
Add a width rule as well
You should add a width and height attribute to the img tags anyway, because it helps the page render a lot faster.
You may also prefer images for SEO reasons (background images aren't treated as part of the content, so you might want to have all your e-shop's product images as img tags, for example)
I am guessing this means that adding height/width inline does the same thing as adding it via class, but it loads faster via inline?
Actually that's not the case once you've added a "max-width" on there, the browser can't determine the size ahead of time. In my custom framework I apply the max-width in a media query, that way does work on desktop.
Yes, the browser can predetermin the size of an asset, and therefore calculate the dimensions and ratio before the image is loaded. In some cases, it prevents your layout from shuffling on (image) load.
Off course that's the case with a max width. The browser can pre-emptively (before the image loads) figure out how scale an image which in turn prevents repaints or reflows which are expensive.
Except that's not what happens (at least, it didn't a year ago when I tested it).
Do you recall whether you did the test via a remote server or local? Thereâ€™s - naturally - a huge difference between getting an image from a local ssd or a 3G network in the train.  In any case, I'll keep it in mind. Thanks.
What I did was link to a non-existing image. If the max-width is not applied, the image still takes up a block the size of the width/height attributes. But as soon as you add max-width it does not.

Edit: example https://jsfiddle.net/pt8f5nd6/
Great to see some competition but if you are writing C# you would be crazy not to be using Visual Studio. I suppose if you are using a non windows platform this could be great for you, though.
When you get used to one of JetBrains IDEs you don't look further when you need to do some programming in other languages.

I do very little work in C#, but when i start hitting wrong shortcuts in Visual Studio it gets really annoying.
Sort of off topic but is JetBrains awesome?  I've heard good things but never checked it out.
Those icons make the baby Jesus cry.
I thought the same about Java and Eclipse. Then I found out about IDEA
I went from a C# dev on visual Studio to an android dev on Idea (android studio). I went back to visual Studio briefly for a side project and I gotta say, idea is the better ide for me. It has all of the functionality of ReSharper built in, and then some. So, I'll be keeping an eye on this project. 

Sorry for random caps, on mobile on the bus. 
Yeah, it would be great to stop having to boot a VM to do my .net work. Definitely going to give this a shot.
Maybe they allow for Mono as well? It's been a bit since I have used Windows and developed in C#, but I would consider doing some work with it if I could use it to work with Mono on OSX and Linux. 
They have a lot of experience making IDEs and also make Resharper, so I think they have a good chance of taking a relevant chunk of VS users, and make VS step up a bit. Competition is good.
Isn't there a big price difference? 
Dismissing VS because of the shortcuts is pretty short-sighted. JetBrains makes quality products, but Visual Studio is also a quality product, and purpose-built for .NET programming.
Pycharm and Idea two of the best IDEs available for python and java development respectively. They have IDEs for many other languages too so you can keep the same aesthetic/ layout/ shortcuts. 

I won't use anything else for my projects (although I'm a student and so have access to all of their products for free), and if I pick up a new language, the jetbrains IDE is the first thing I install after the compiler/ interpreter. 
I've always hated eclipse with a passion and could never understand why everyone raved about it.  

I always used JCreator when I was doing Java, but I hear that it's pretty awful these days
VS Community is free though.
Visual Studio Express is free and more than enough for most people and the full version is available through BizSpark as well if you qualify. The full version has a cost associated with it, though. I believe the cost it's around $2500.  However, if you reach the point where you need to purchase this, the cost is going to be pretty negligible. 
IntelliJ Idea is more expensive than Visual Studio Pro, which comes with a lot of additional perks like azure credits, VS Team services (agile planning, unlimited repos, cloud testing, continuous integration), bunch of licenses for windows and SQL Server and training for the platform + support from MSFT + free courses at 3rd party sites. Visual Studio Unlimited is quite a bit more expensive, but includes a ton more stuff. 
I use ReSharper a lot for C# development, it is fantastic. At work we use Java, I used IDEA for a bit and found it really nice. The setup I'm really liking right now is running Eclipse in the background with vim + Eclim.

Eclim is a small plugin that allows my vim to communicate with the Eclipse instance running in the background. So I get all the necessary features from an IDE for Java development (automatic imports, code completion, etc), but I get to edit with vim in a terminal. It's pretty sweet.
I believe can get the full version for free now. It's called Visual Studio Community Edition 2015. 
Visual Studio Pro starts at $500 https://www.visualstudio.com/products/how-to-buy-vs
There must be a lighter way to implement this instead of loading the 300mb+ eclipse these days.
This is some pretty standard things you learn at a basic level of web development, but still a good read for the newcomers that have just gotten into web dev, but the title is a bit misleading. All of the points you mentioned applies to all kinds of web applications and not only Wordpress.

> If the load time of your site is more than 4 seconds or your web page size is more than 2MB, then that can be a big issue...

I heavily disagree with the above quote. I think that every developer should strive towards sub-second loading times, at least *perceptively*. Lightweight & performant sites feels really good, but I can't say that I've ever seen a Wordpress site being any of them.

EDIT: Prime example of standard Wordpress sites is the one where this blog post resides: http://i.imgur.com/AXkGGrg.png
How to speed up your wordpress site 101:

Im guessing this is for everyone using Wordpress. 

Im new to the subreddit but why? Wordpress success is tremendous. The cost/benefit factor is fantastic in most cases.
How to speed up your * 101:
- Stop using *
I personally just ditched a WordPress site for Grav CMS which is 100% flatfile, responsive out of the box and way faster on its own.

I host my own stuff on a dedicated server I own running Server 2012 R2 and IIS, and with literally no changes to the IIS website settings, I cut a ~4second loading timer into a ~0.5second loading timer. 

Ultimately it does its job well as a CMS but for those of us more conscious about some of the hidden considerations of webdev it's far from my first choice.
I think it's great for some sites but people tend to install wordpress as a go to for everything and all that overhead is ridiculous. 
> Responsive out of the box

Every default WordPress theme has been responsive since 2012. The admin area has also been responsive for the same amount of time.

Your ignorance is blatant.
Interesting. Im guessing that the overhead is paid by the customer and is very small in terms of dollars. What would be the alternative for the broad majority?
It's just grossly slow and bloated
That cost is still miniscule. The bottomline is A webpage is ridiculously cheap and provides excellent value. Caching is easy to setup if you need it and want to bypass some bloat. With PHP 7.0 it will run up to 40% faster than previous PHP version. 
It is bloated. A lot of functionality you will not use. But maybe you will use at a later point and there is a concievable point to having that option directly at least.

From the little I know there are not one single framework that goes without criticism. What would be the alternative for the broad majority?
It's not a cost thing, it's just an incredible waste of time. Installing hundreds of files and configuring the WP setup simply doesn't make much sense for most sites. It's overkill. If you're running a blog or updating a great deal then sure, it's fine, but the majority of sites have very basic needs. A few pages of html and you're set. 

Installing hundreds of files is a small problem or the host has a one-click installer and tons of community support and documentation.

The support for added features could conceivably come in handy at a later point.

So what is the alternative that is better for the vast majority?
I would recommend a few pages of html in most cases. I'm not sure what your needs are. 
That is not for the vast majority of people. Not even for a one page blog. Its simply not comparable. They dont know HTML or CSS. 

There would not even be the simples WYSIWYG editing for the posts.

They cant make anything like a modern responsive WP theme with good formatting for images/menus/blocks.

Even if they knew HTML/CSS/Javascript etc. Everyone would spend hours to build a site so that they could save a few seconds of processor-cycles on a serverfarm.

 Im getting downvoted to hell here. Thanks /r/webdev/ but I just want a sensible answer.

BTW I dont even use Wordpress but I have recommeded it to several customers. I would love to send them elsewhere if there was a better alternative.
I'm not sure you're reading what I've said. I stated that for a simple blog or whatever it's fine. However blogs are not commercial development in most cases. For some reason I thought that was your angle. My apologies. 

Most commercial development is incredibly simple with little needed overhead. 

Edit: If you are sending customers to use WP I feel that would be a bad choice for previously stated reasons. 
[deleted]
I've said multiple times that WP is fine for blogs. 
what state do you live in? This should be asked in /r/legaladvice
A conviction for something with no relation to the web development field shouldn't affect your job prospects, its not like it was something more specific to web development such as impersonation fraud or selling company secrets/codebase.
Smaller agencies are unlikely to do much checking for entry level positions. They are usually underpaid exploitative positions that people use as a stepping stone and don't hang around in long anyway.
Not sure if they could do some optimization, but try [Box View API](https://box-view.readme.io/reference)

Please optimise that image. I'm on a fast connection and it's taking ages.
Aside from the huge images that others have mentioned your HTML structure could do with some work. `<ul>`s should only have `<li>`s inside them not `<div>`s. 

Paragraphed text should be in `<p>` tags not `<li>` unless it is an actual list item.

For future reference it's far easier to build a responsive (dynamic) design from the start rather than add it in afterwards. There are CSS frameworks that can help you out on the layout [bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) and [foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/) are both widely used and will aid layout text spacing and making you site responsive for mobile/tablet users. They also have a lot of answered questions on stack overflow which you can reference if you get stuck.
22 MB transferred and took 35 secs to load the page. I'd suggest you to optimize your images as @mlsn mentioned.
From a design perspective, I'd take out the clip-arty swirl/flower in the background. It makes sites look less professional. Look at websites with modern/contemporary designs and you won't see clip-art in their backgrounds. 
First off, great job :) and welcome to the awesome world of webdev. Just a couple of little tips: optimize your images (I like to use imageoptim but there's dozens of other tools). Stick your Javascript into an external file, when you start writing a lot of JS it helps to split it out from the actual markup of your site. Instead of having <div id="footer"> and <div class="footer"> why not use <footer>? A lot more semantic, which is what HTML5 is all about :) it also looks like you could get rid of several <div>'s completely. Remember, unless you absolutely need it for styling purposes, try to use as little markup as possible and avoid <div>ception.
Looks pretty good, I would suggest using a different font (Google Fonts is great for that).  Also give the paragraph text better line-spacing (1.2-1.5em) and you should almost never use straight black for text color.  Use an off-black such as #222 or #444.  Lastly, on the front page image in the middle section towards the bottom, add some space between it and its text.
The Calgary image is being used as a thumbnail, but you haven't resized it. It is still huge. It is 2556x1018 and 7.5MB.
There's nothing wrong with a plain website.

There's a scrollbar behind the footer on small breakpoints. It seems like the footer isn't responsive.
Some simple suggestions. 

1) Clean up the URLs (ie www.fwac.ca/index.html = www.fwac.ca/ and www.fwac.ca/Contact.html = www.fwac.ca/contact) This will make it look more professional and modern.

2) The menu isn't responsive.

3) The flower background art (personal preference) must go.

Over all looks good. Good job. 

I actually love the flowers on the background--and I think I might be more in the target audience than most of webdev :) Purely aesthetically, the site is lovely. I would strongly recommend putting in dummy images in your secondary pages, because you're definitely going to want some images there, and you don't want to have to arrange them in ways complimentary to the rest of the design at the last minute.
Firstly congrats on your first professional gig, it's looking good! Simple is fine, the content is the most important part, and complex designs often get in the way.

File size has been mentioned - here is a useful tool that will give you some insight into that and other metrics. It's not necessary to achieve 100% but yours is currently at 0/100 for Speed :)

https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/

Your design is quite nice and clean which is good, and there is important and useful information within the first glance of the user. Nice. However you need to think about readability, which can be enhanced by good typography and contrast, both of which you need to improve.

Check this out for typography -
http://practicaltypography.com/typography-in-ten-minutes.html

and for contrast, consider how light your yellow text is against the background, and how much the large background design interferes with the text. Maybe some solid background tiles for the text to sit on would help.

Body text on the web tends not to be center aligned. We are trained to move our eyes back to a solid left margin when reading, having a ragged left makes it more tiring to read.

Finally, have you tried it on mobile or in chrome dev tools mobile emulation? Web sites these days should all be responsive from the get go in my opinion. A css framework such as Bootstrap or Foundation can help a lot with this and is really worth learning if you're going to be building more websites.
This is a good place to start.

Your images are killing my browser! Looks pretty good for a first though :)
Resize your images to a more sensible size, run them through https://kraken.io/
Good work dude. I would look into using media queries, your site seems to take a break at lower pixel resolutions. 
It needs media queries for different devices. When I make my browser smaller the page looks like a garbled mess. Other than that, I think it looks pretty professional.
Some html is fucked up for smaller browser windows. (Main headline + some scrollbar in the footer.)
I'm hoping there's a reason you hand coded it because it probably would have been a lot simpler to use a cms or template. 
[While my browser gently weeps](http://i.imgur.com/RopSBSD.png)
Can stretch it across my 3 monitors and still not see pixels!
This is going to be a dumb question, but how do you know how much was transferred when you visited the page?
Should I have them the max dimensions that they would be displayed on the page?  Or is simply optimization enough?
So much this. Those images are a deal breaker.
Optimized with tinypng and resized images to the same dimensions as they'll be displayed.  Images are still taking nearly 6s.  Anything else you recommend?
Should I have them the max dimensions that they would be displayed on the page? Or is simply optimization enough?
They also flash in your face when navigating tabs since they're different on every page.
Should I have them the max dimensions that they would be displayed on the page? Or is simply optimization enough?
Kraken is fine, but I find https://tinypng.com/ friendlier and easier to use.
The learning experience alone is a good reason. Making sites from scratch is great practice for beginners. 
Dev tools, network tab, F5, totals are at the bottom.
Awesome. Good start. I'm also seeing a few layout issues on smaller (mobile) resolutions. Might want to get some mediaqueries to address the column layout on the homepage.

If you can then drop the quality of some of those images, so the file size is smaller. Have a look at using srcset and having multiple sizes of each image. That way the browser will only load the optimum file size that it needs. 
I generally have the images max dimensions that they should be on the frontend, and also optimize them in order to reduce the size. So both would be ok (y)
Yeah im well aware of this, having done ot myself but not for a client as the op suggested 
Thank you.
Optimized with tinypng and resized images to the same dimensions as they'll be displayed.  Images are still taking nearly 6s.  Anything else you recommend?
Yes I'll be adding media queries today.  I wonder if the current layout is okay for all pc use.  It seems that 1400x900 displays nicely, but anything smaller we start to get horizontal scroll bars and some elements shifting.  Should I add an intermediate media query between a mobile size and 1400x900?

I'll have a look at having multiple sized images. 
Sounds good.  Thanks!
Optimized with tinypng and resized images to the same dimensions as they'll be displayed.  Images are still taking nearly 6s.  Anything else you recommend?
Good point.
I would use jpg instead of png. There isnt any specific reason the images need to be perfect. They are decorative and I assume are not the purpose for the website. I saved [This photo](http://www.fwac.ca/img/ocean.png), which was over 300 KB, as a jpg from photoshop(8 quality). [Here is the result.](http://i.imgur.com/HPjso9D.jpg) Open both images and flip back and forth, I bet you can't see a difference. The jpg version is only 108 KB.
Try not to set widths using fixed values such as px, em etc and use % instead. You can restrain the width using max-width when you get to that biggest view you want.

In general you should let the layout fill the space available and then use media queries to update the layout from 1 column to 2 to 3 as the browser width increases. That way you only need media queries when things start to look to spaced out or too cramped.

Hope that helps.


Hi sorry for the late response, you should probably check your server configuration if you have nginx make sure you have gzip enabled and have the optimized configuration, I'd also recommend you to use varnish in order to cache static pages, images, css etc.
Hm jpg's are smaller.  Good to know.  Cheers.
Just being pedantic, but they aren't simply smaller. They use lossy compression, whereas PNG doesn't. You can make a JPG too small and it will look like crap, but you can get a sufficient quality for most applications without losing too much. Glad I could help.
I'm disapointed that they didn't embed https://html5zombo.com/ somehow.
Is it my browser or is this page giving me the silent treatment ?

>Iâ€™m tired of Text Editors and Command Line Interfaces. I want dragondrop, I no longer have any clue how this thing works anyhow.
> Dreamweaver evolved towards being an efficient code editor and eventually obsoleted itâ€™s companion product, Homesite.

No, it didn't. Homesite was one of the first casualties in a long line of web related products that Adobe mismanaged and mangled. It was supposedly "integrated" into Dreamweaver, which meant adopting a handful of its features, but losing all of its refinement and developer focus. I personally continued using Homesite long after Adobe stopped supporting it. DW was not cutting it, even back then. 

It was Macromedia which made all of the innovations. I can only surmise the corporate culture at Adobe forced out the original talent, as the existing mindset systematically ruined everything web related to this day. 

Flash continued to thrive for a short while, in spite of Adobe, not because of it. It's current obsolete status and fervent abandonment by the web development community is indicative of Adobe's product development. 

DreamWeaver exists only because of its packaging with Adobe's mainstay programs, like cable channels you happen to watch because they're included, and a small outlier of developers addicted to its "Site management" feature. 

In the DW world, ftp is still relevant, and jQuery is the only code hinting that matters. It's not time to reconsider DreamWeaver, it's time to kill it, so something useful can take its place. 
Complete beginners are now better served by sitebuilders like squarespace and shopify, while anyone more advanced than that makes use of css and js frameworks. Dreamweaver's market share is being shrunk at both ends, and I can't see that changing.
Use what you like and are comfortable with. 
I liked how the templating works, It usually depends on how would you like to start things out, My company would have 1 template for a certain project site so that other developers who work at different shifts would have no problem implementing site layouts plus the use of creative cloud is pretty useful especially PSD to HTML/HTML5 projects, but Text Editors works fine as well.
Oh God that camel case on the HTML onevent attributes! Bad memories. 
Couldn't say it better
nuff said 
I'm really not excited about dragon drops.
> jQuery is the only code hinting that matters

If you can reliably recall which way round strpos() and in_array() arguments go then hurrah for you,  but I need that hinty goodness! 
The point was that DW hints on select libraries; hence jQuery (and now bootstrap) seems to be the only library that matters. 

Meanwhile, just about any half-decent code editor will hint on any library you import, any external library you designate and will also hint on your own code. 
Including,  it must be said,  DW. I have CS5 and it hints variable and function names from included files. To be fair, this was so unexpected the first time that I panicked I'd duplicated a library function, because that seemed a more credible explanation.
I have little experience with word press but I would check file permissions and ownership. 

Check the .htaccess and httpd.conf or similar settings for redirects, it is likely that website A is redirecting all urls so that they are a query arg to index.php, and website B excludes them if they have a file extension like .html.
WordPress pages shouldn't have the .html extension, try "websiteA.com/folder/mypage".
Check the file permissions for website A. The files and directories need to be readable by the web server. Some need to be writable as well. Make sure you uploaded the .htaccess file to website A. Sometimes this file is missed because it starts with a ".".
Depression
I have been in web development for over 15 years and still feel this way. Partly because things change so rapidly and to keep up you always have to be in learning mode. I think not knowing as much as your peers is not always a bad thing. Just means there is room for you to learn and strive for more. The plus side is you don't ever have to worry about getting bored as long as you don't get burned out on constantly learning. 
I've come to realize that a major part of my job, and everyone else's, is learning. Technology changes fast, especially in the Web space, and no one knows everything. I only have about 2 years of experience, but I've found that I often grasp new concepts much faster than some coworkers with 10+ years of experience. This could be due to me being younger, or they're too caught up on older ways of thinking , or maybe I'm just a better google-er,  but the bottom line is my lack of experience is not the disadvantage I thought it would be. 
I think seeing or hearing of someone who is way worse at what you do. It makes you feel more valuable.
[This article by David Walsh](https://davidwalsh.name/impostor-syndrome) is a brilliant read.

He makes some brilliant points on why we come to feel like an imposter for example:

> Every programming task's efficiency is measurable, meaning our colleague can write a routine to complete the same task and it may be 1300% more efficient, making us feel that much worse.

-

>We forget that our job is just a fraction of our lives and there's a real world outside of this hateful, illuminated screen

-

>We probably stay on our computers after the "day job" which leads to intense feelings of being burnt out

But his points on how we **aren't** an imposter and advice on how to start to steer away from that train of thought are really reassuring:

>You believe you might be an impostor -- those who think they're experts are anything but, those who know they aren't experts know how much they don't know

-

>You get work -- whether it's a big company job or enough to pay the bills, you can make money punching keys on a computer (have you seen people who aren't tech savvy try to do anything on a computer?)

>Look at your (hopefully decent) employment history and know that, on a basic level, you're much more wanted than you're wanted gone

-

>Realize that people who consider themselves "experts", and don't go through waves of self doubt, are idiots that are so arrogant to not know what they don't know

-

>Perform any simply exercise in the JavaScript console

-

>BLOG!  The worst thing that can happen is someone corrects you and you learn something out of it

That last one has actually inspired me to start to put content together for a blog. Even if no one reads it, it can still be a record of "Hey, I understand these things and I'm not actually that bad".
I realize that it's just "Inferiority complex" dressed up a little differently and that people have been dealing with it for ages (it's not something specific to programming or IT or whatever) and move the fuck on i guess.
Let me start by saying this: You're not less of a webdev because you don't know something that someone else knows. 

I've been a webdev for a long time (since 1996). There is a FUCKTON of stuff that I don't know. This "syndrome", as you call it, is actually the thing that keeps me interested in webdev. There's ALWAYS something new and interesting to learn and there will always be something new and interesting to learn.
Try to work with the right people. Try to structure your work life so that you work with people that are fundamentally collaborative, easy going, non judgemental and continually eager to help you increase your skills while at the same time challenge you to find the best solution to every problem.
I have worked with so many ego driven developers who set up the work environment in a confrontational, argumentative manner. That seem to find it personally distasteful when you don't know a particular thing or disagree with them on their opinions. It put me always on the defensive and made it hard to recognize the value of my own work - hence leading to imposter syndrome.
Work and life is so much better now that I have an awesome team of supportive devs that commend me when I do something well and, when criticizing a particular piece of code, keep a healthy modesty that they might actually be wrong and I might be right.
Yeah there will always be more to know and learn, but thats also what makes this job great. As long as you do your best, get the job done and continually strive to do better it doesn't freaking matter if you know more or less than your colleagues, so long as you all have a healthy respect for one another as professionals. What we do is a TEAM effort and everyone will have their own strengths to add to the team. 
On the flip side, be that dude for the rest of your team too, you might just be able to change the culture of your workplace for the better.
Deliverables. Do you deliver stuff that other people want? There is so much to know that pretty much any two equal developers could amaze each other with some esoteric knowledge. There are AI whizzes, 3D whizzes, networking whizzes, those people who know the ins and outs of the compiler, but it all circles back to deliverables. 

I know people who will reprogram the linux kernal to do what I would do with a Python script. Who is the better programmer?

This is also what separates the great from the good, the good from the bad. There are those who quickly deliver stuff that is good. There are those who slowly deliver stuff that is bad, and worst of all are those who don't deliver. Then there are the worst of the worst; they deliver absolute vomit and somehow convince people that it is solid gold.

There is one tier worse than that though. The developers who think that they are god's gift to programming. Often they have some certification or degree from a very fancy institution. They will then run interference with the best programmers telling them that they are doing it wrong. Worse than that they will mount campaigns to pretty much bring all development to a halt. They will insist that the highly successful project is on the brink of collapse and the only thing to do is to recode it in Haskell; a language where they studied under one of the core founders of the language. Where these types are detectable is that they spend more time schmoozing than programming.



I deal with it every time I come on here lol. As someone who is still very new to web dev (a yearish, and a half if you count work experience and playing around) all the advanced chatter is a little scary. It makes me worry that I'm trapped and that catching up with the industry is futile.

Then I remind myself that learning is a wonderful thing. A year ago, php was the devil in my eyes. I could not get my head around how it worked no matter what I did. Now I build apps with it on the reg and can even set up a basic LAMP VPS with minimal hassle. Don't stop growing, don't stop trying to understand new things.
[deleted]
By being honest with yourself and with others and saying, "I don't have any experience with x technology/language/etc". There's no way you can know everything and it's not necessarily a sign of your ineptitude, but a chance to learn something new.
Participate in technical interviews for new employees :)
It drives me crazy, but it's something I just always keep in check. I'm a developer with 10+ years experience. Multiple languages, platforms and frameworks. Always being in learning mode does make it the struggle. I keep up on side projects and work on things that I find interesting whenever I get a chance.

I've realized that beyond general knowledge of computers and their languages, my biggest skill sets are reading to the end of the sentence and problem solving like you wouldn't believe.
I was dealing with it until I got turned down from a bunch of jobs and laid off from the one I had. :(


My job was great until a new CTO came in who looks his nose down at all sorts of things, like being a front end developer or not having a full CS degree. Everyone told me how awesome he was and that he was great, but he always treated me like a silly little girl. It was really crushing. I shy away from saying it was about sexism, but I wonder about how the guys had such a great relationship with him and none of the women had the same experience, it was like we were talking about two different people. 


I think though the best thing is to keep building stuff, anything. 
Transform it into motivation to be better.
This is posted like twice a week
Look at some of my coworkers as the real imposters
Thanks to the pace of software technology, we are all salmon swimming up steam.  You were an expert in your domain 5 years ago, now there's the new hot thing the cool kids are using.  Better learn it, now you are just starting out again. 
Imposter syndrome is a cycle, and it's not an illusion.  It's how the arrogant pricks justify their self doubt at various stages in the cycle, so they can become arrogant pricks again.
Others realize they don't know everything and that it is ok to be in that state, and live with reality.
A cynical pov, true, but a valid one.

You will only experience impostor syndrome when you are skilled at something.

Repeat to yourself as many times as necessary.
By the realization that everyone else on my team feels the same way, as does every level of management (except executive management, whose confident delusions of grandeur we should all model ourselves on).

It's important to know that there is *always* someone better than you. Instead of viewing your peers as unreachable monoliths, use them to your advantage and learn from them the things you feel you don't already know.

The guy I work with is leaps and bounds ahead of me in terms of knowledge and programming capability. But I do my best and when he gives me the thumbs up it lessens the feeling a little bit.

Besides, no one likes a know it all.
I look at my paycheck. 
I think it's important to realize, at least I've found, is what makes technical people technical people is curiosity and the desire to learn. One thing in common I've found with most "computer people" is we weren't afraid to learn. At some point in your life, you wanted to know what typing in a command or clicking a button did, so you did it. Most computer folk I know, myself included, spent a lot of time breaking things before they were competent to build/fix things. This is in stark opposition to non-technical people who are afraid of breaking things or feel stupid when they don't know how to do something so they don't bother.
  
Recognize the hallmark of someone suited to be a dev isn't someone who knows everything, it's someone who is deeply curious and craves knowledge and mastery in technical matters. Don't lose sight of that, and just keep improving.
Happens all the time when you come to r/webdev and read "How to do X thing using A, B, and C and X, A, B and C are all things you've never used.
It's a really large problem... if you don't recall, I asked about this in [a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/3zx3pa/question_how_to_deal_with_low_self_esteem_in/) a bit ago. Honestly do what you do and get an outside opinion like I did.

Your peers probably feel the same way. They probably think you're like miles above them and they suck. Depression is a problem, especially with such a toxic and asocial community. Everyone feels like they need to one up everyone else in this community IMHO, and all it contributes to is depression. Maybe it's because as a male dominated community we feel the need to be better than everyone to prove our skill.

**edit:** i'm 13 take my opinion witta grain of salt i really don't know much
Honestly, I think impostor syndrome results from a lack of perspective. We can't all be the industry thought leaders, inventing new languages and writing books on best practices. 

This sounds arrogant, but I think of how few we are. STEM occupations account for [~5%](http://www.esa.doc.gov/sites/default/files/stemfinalyjuly14_1.pdf) of the workforce. Of that, [~12%](http://dpeaflcio.org/programs-publications/issue-fact-sheets/the-stem-workforce-an-occupational-overview/) are in computer/mathematics. So, roughly speaking, we account for a half percent of the workforce. 

The way I see it, if we're doing work that only 1 out of 200 people can do, how are we impostors?
Study and teach yourself. That's literally it.
I started my own [sideproject](https://github.com/Leo-G/Flask-Scaffold) which I constantly try to improve with latest technology, this helps learn and stay upto date, I help my peers as well and learn as much as I can from them, I found that sharing is also a way of learning so I share my learnings on my [blog](http://techarena51.com) as well
Mixed with a bottle of whiskey.
Im still new and feel like any time I ask for help that its cheating.
I think a part of it could be burn out from the other devs.  I've gone through that on and off through out my career.  

Thankfully, I'm feeling motivated lately and I've gotten myself out of a rut.
I'm in the same boat, yes my coworker has 10+ years of experience in Java and he's a master of the Javaland, but let me tell you, websites/hybrid apps/databases/server setups can't be done with Java and in that perspective i feel above my co-worker.

Of course i'm not a douche and i accept the fact he's a higher payed and more experienced developer and i always give him value by asking questions and his opinion on the "how the app is supposed to work" front and if he asks i will gladly explain him in details what's going on without mocking him for asking.

As a rule of thumb the younger you are the more you search for new stuff and you know more technologies than anyone ! But the experience on how the code flow is supposed to go and how to check it correctly is something a more experienced developer can help you with and also give you advice on how to deal with certain problems faster than searching on google.

Also respect their experience and opinion and keep asking them, you will learn alot
As bad as it sounds, I'm also guilty of this..
I feel bad when I do this too, but it helps balance out all the stories I read of fantastic programmers who stay up late one night, code an entire complex web application, and then built a multi-million dollar business off of it the next day.  You always hear of the successful ending, not the fifty failed starts or the nights fighting with buggy code only to realize - ten hours in - that it's due to a misplaced semi-colon or the fact that they had to ask around for help on how to code sections.

It's like those photos people post of their pristine houses where you just know that there's a big mess just outside the border of the photo.
When someone much more experienced than you are in programming breaks something you made in a different language and has to ask you to fix it...
feelsgoodman. it shouldn't, but honestly it does, at least for me.
I totally agree with this. Self proclaimed experts are rarely experts. I've also found that the peers who downplayed their skill level, were actually the ones who knew the most.  I think it's healthy to feel like you don't know as much as your peers. It's motivation to keep learning. 
Good stuff here! "Realize that people who consider themselves "experts", and don't go through waves of self doubt, are idiots that are so arrogant to not know what they don't know" 
So true!
Post a link once you've got content on that blog of yours, I'm sure a few of us would like to give it a read.
I think you are the only one answering that actually knows what imposter syndrome is.
Just to clarify: "There's stuff I don't know" is **NOT** Imposter Syndrome. So many people here acting like Imposter Syndrome just means not thinking you're the best dev in the company. 

Imposter Syndrome is the very real constant fear that someone will 'find you out' - that you're not as good as you think they are, that you shouldn't really have the job you have, that you're going to be fired when they realise that you're nothing near as good as they expect you to be, that they're going to look at your code and realise you have no idea what you're doing...

This is not the same thing as "knowing you can't know everything ever".
I'm also on the same boat -- started out with pure, raw PHP/MySQL to doing Drupal for the past few years. 
I think 90% of the time anyone asks me if I know how to do something and I don't, chances are I will look it up briefly for a minute or two and then answer "nope, but I will in a week"
We are all frauds.
... and weed.
ahh... the good ol Balmers Peak
Don't do this to yourself. Always ask for help if you need. No one knows everything, and you will get work done faster by seeking help when you are blocked. People take pride in working their way through problems, which is usually great, but some problems aren't worth it. Some problems don't require critical thinking. They may be solved by just knowing there is some api function that isn't well documented or that there is a known bug, or something. Not every mountain is worth climbing, especially when someone can show you an easier/better way.

 And if your boss or coworkers think less of you for asking for help, than you are in the wrong place.
My philosophy has always been to look up my problem and try and solve it to the very best of my ability...for like maybe an hour max, and even then that's usually too long.  If you've tried your best, exhausted your attempts at solving the problem, and can't find a solution.  Ask for help.  There's no shame in it.  You're not supposed to know everything!  And next time you come across the problem, you'll know how to solve it easily.   There are times when there's just a really simple solution that someone else on your team knows that you just haven't worked with before.  How are you supposed to know how that works unless you ask someone, right?

Basically, ask for help.  Try to solve your problem yourself first, but don't be afraid to get someone to help you out because it means you'll get back to fixing more problems even sooner.
Don't be afraid to ask for help. Search and look for solutions first and try to solve things yourself. You will learn much more that way and things will stick more if you are able to solve it yourself. BUT if you get stuck please ask for help. Go to the person with a list of things you tried to do to solve it yourself which will open up the conversation and show him/her that you are trying to put the effort in.
Exactly. I've always tried to tell other developers that find themselves in ruts that it's all about learning and progressing. After all, it's in the name itself: Development.
Impostor Syndrome isn't "not knowing everything" but the fast paced world of web development can exasperate the feeling of being an impostor.  Just when you think you've got a good handle on things, there's someone doing even better things with a technology you've barely heard of.  It's impossible to keep up and it leaves one feeling that you're an impostor because you don't know X.  (Never mind that you're an expert in A, B, and C.)
I had no idea it was a thing. I've never heard the term before so I equated it to low self esteem, sorry.
Another PHP chap here!
haha, yeah. a bit like this scene: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vMO3XmNXe4
Thanks for the response. I haven't done serious learning since high school, and that was almost 10 years ago. I guess I forgot how the learning process works. Glad to know these things. 
I like this field a lot because of that. Hell earlier today I was super frustrated because I was sucking major dick at getting my images to be responsive. Called it quits before I killed one of my cats and started working on my Weather API project, and to my surprise understood easily how AJAX worked (first time AJAX'er) and got it working.

It's funny to see myself on a spectrum with this stuff, but its really fun!
Nah don't worry, it's pretty closely linked with low self esteem, but it's extra specific.
[How to handle 301 redirects](https://moz.com/learn/seo/redirection)

You can force search engines to learn that website.com/en/ is the old location, and that website.com is where you want them to go. Normal users that accidentally go to website.com/en/ will be redirected to the new website.com location. Make sure you do a 301 redirect, not a 302 redirect.
You can specify Canonical URLs in your /en/ page:

    <link rel="canonical" href="http://www.website.com" />

The difference between this method and .htaccess is that using a 301 in .htaccess redirects from the /en/ page to the home page, and Google should eventually index only the home page. Since you can't access your .htaccess file, canonicalization is another option.  By using canonical URLs, the /en/ page can still be accessed, but you're explicitly telling google to consider that page to be www.website.com. Google will eventually index that instead of /en/.

There's no harm in doing both, but obviously you can't.
thank you, I tried a .htaccess file but Aabaco hosting is useless and doesn't allow them... is there another way to do a 301 redirect other than .htaccess?
fixed through php redirect file in /en/ thank you for the article
Um. Odd.

Well, maybe change the www.website.com/en/ index file to have a redirect built into it? Use Javascript or PHP to do it I guess. Or whatever the site is built in. Django, RoR, whatever
As far as search goes, I don't know how this will affect your SEO, but glad you got it fixed
Wrote you a little sumpin': http://codepen.io/ForScale/full/JGyXKZ
Just use whatever carousel package you like and add your markup to each slide.

Image slideshows is just one use for a carousel - they will take any content though, even entire pages as you want to do.

I recommend Slick - http://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/


In that case, is it possible to attach a javascript scroll to method from the navbar to take me to that certain part of the carousel?
check out the Slider Syncing section on the link above.  The little thumbnails would serve as your navigation (remember, they don't have to be images) and you would set the number of slidesToShow to be greater than your number of nav links (so that the entire navbar shows).  would that work?



[JIRA](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira). It's pretty good.
Our company uses JIRA, it is decent enough
Main is JIRA. For junior training/reports Basecamp. For freelance I use github, imo JIRA would be overkill for only me. I've also tried asana when I was working with my friend on social network applications, imo it lacked functionality. 
We use Zendesk for tracking internal issues such as IT tickets. For development we use JIRA
It depends on the type of client.

For more technical clients (most of mine), I have set up [Trac](http://trac.edgewall.org/) as they can deal with the not as friendly user interface. (yes it can all be tweaked).

For systems where we need end user interaction, so far (only have one client needing it) we are using [Freshdesk](https://freshdesk.com/) and like it. We have it handling any incoming e-mail for support@their-domain.com.
We use TargetProcess Kanban.  It's alright but good god, the mashup API is not documented - the developer site has mashup api documentation but it is for an older version which is completely different.
+1 for Jira
I know [PDF.js](https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/) is a big deal. Nice nick btw.
So will this allow me to read the meta data within the pdf? And thanks! Lol
If you want a nice, free, SaaS I would go with [Wave.](https://www.waveapps.com/)

I used this back when I was freelancing and it worked great for my needs. Plus side it looks pretty nice too! 
I really like this reddit user's side project /u/key-frames credit


[Angular invoice](https://thirdwishcreative.com/invoice/)
I use PDF. I have a 'template' document (of my own design) set up in LibreOffice which I copy and fill in the details.
I use Freshbooks to handle invoices
So you didn't get paid 50% up front? Ah well, that's a different conversation ðŸ˜€

I use Harvest (http://harvestapp.com). Not only is the time tracking pretty sweet but the invoices are really good. You can even set it up to let your clients pay online.
Well, I got a few spreadsheets tracking my hours and a Word template that I create pdf bills from which I mail to my customers.

May not be very scalable but for me it's alright. (Freelancing to finance my computer science studies I am doing.)
On first inspection, this is exactly what I'm looking for! Is there any reason you wouldn't recommend this? Anything they could improve? I want to hear cons as well as pros  :)
Wow, I love it! I was expecting software or cloud solutions, but this is so crisp and clean! It looks like it's just something he made on his website; is there a version that can be downloaded or something?
I used FreshBooks when I still did a lot of freelance. It was fucking awesome. 
This was my first freelancing project, so I was a little more relaxed about protocol because I was treating it as a trial run; I need the income but I wasn't sure how much I could handle outside of my full-time job. That said, I'm optimistic about continuing to freelance on the side and have already started getting my ducks in a row, including setting up a password manager, getting this payment thing figured out, and establishing more practical business habits, like up-front payment.

I'll look into Harvest! I'm definitely interested in online payments. Thanks for the suggestion! 
Well. I haven't been freelancing for over a year, but from just looking at the site it seems they have made tons of UI enhancements. So it is good to see they are constantly developing it. My only issue with it at the time is that it *only* does accrual based accounting, and can not do cash based accounting. This can be frustrating as it does not reflect your actual cash on hand in a month. 

However, if you are just wanting a way to invoice and keep track of payments, and are less interested in the full on accounting/reporting side of things then it is perfect. But if you are trying to run your own business, something along these lines is almost necessary.
Yea that site you would be able to edit everything in there and then download as a pdf, or if you want to edit it further, you can use his github [here](https://github.com/joshkirk/AngularJS-Invoice)
If you mean what I think you do, Last Pass is a fab password manager. 
[This](http://i.imgur.com/tZOS8.gif) is how I react when I see flash in a website now.
The obligatory answer here is that if you're building new sites in Flash, you're going to have a bad time.

It's not supported on most mobile devices, and businesses and more and more banning it across the network.
Your paths are different ... 
Totally understand but it's what the client has asked for since they already have a little slideshow built. 
well all of the files are in the story1 folder in my public_html folder.
I've tried changing paths to every possible variation I could think of and get the same result. 
Based on that the paths should be correct right?
Why in story 1, why not root? If your index files are in story 1 with the rest of your files then it's still treated as root. 

Think of paths as sub sections within your box ... You only need to define full paths like story1 if the files arent all grouped together in the same folder. 

Make sense?
I've tried also doing
mywebsite.com/story1/story.html

story.html is a page that displays the flash file but I just get a 404 page as if the page isn't on my server. Is this a wordpress function?
I'm using 
Whoa whoa whoa ... You're doing this for WordPress?
Yes.. Did I screw something up?
Eh ... no not exactly. But WordPress handles files and code completely differently. It also reads from the WordPress folders structure rather than just the root server paths ... and depending on what is interacting there is specific guidelines in place. I'd have to look at the whole thing rather than a snippet to figure out what you're doing vs trying to do. 

Next time lead with the fact that you're using a cms :p
Web development is a great industry to get into and there are many different languages you can learn that are good for web development. I'd suggest looking at [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/). I haven't used it in awhile, but it was really good when I looked at it.

&nbsp;  
If you're a complete beginner, I'd suggest first learning HTML and CSS. Those two languages are not really programming, but instead markup languages. But they are the base of web development.

&nbsp;  
Next is where you start getting into more decisions about where to go. After learning the basics of HTML and CSS, which will give you the skills to build static webpages, you can take two routes in learning your next language:

* **JavaScript**  
JavaScript has recently become a viable and powerful language for server-side processing, but traditionally is mostly used on the client-side to add extra bells and whistles and do validation before sending data to the server.

* **More traditional server-side language**  
Languages such as PHP, Java, ASP.NET, Ruby, etc. These languages are more traditionally used on the server-side.

&nbsp;  
This is just *my opinion*, but I'd go into a server-side language after learning HTML and CSS. That's just because it's more interesting to me and I feel like it's more useful for building data-driven applications as it allows you to interact with databases, upload files, and interact with the server. After learning a server-side language, I'd go back to JavaScript and especially learn jQuery (a very popular and powerful JavaScript library). I also want to mention, that most web pages beyond static pages will use a combination of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a server-side language.

&nbsp;  
As for which server-side language to learn, that's mostly preference. There are tons of places where you can find "X language is better than Y language." But in the end, it's mostly dependent on personal preference, the app you want to build, or the job you want to get.

&nbsp;  
The more popular languages seem to be PHP, Ruby (with Ruby on Rails), and Python (with Django). PHP is everywhere and you'll have no problems finding hosting provider support. If you use a framework such as Laravel or CodeIgniter it will give you similar features as Ruby on Rails and Django and also make development much faster and more fun. Ruby is growing fast and has a big following. I'm honestly not sure about Python and Django though, I've never looked into them much. If you're purely worried about jobs, PHP probably has more jobs out there, while Ruby is apparently popular with startups.

&nbsp;  
Java or ASP.NET (C# or Visual Basic) are also other options out there although I feel they're a bit more common in large companies, especially Java. I have extensive experience in ASP.NET MVC and it's fun to work with. But you'll be limited to Windows servers only.

&nbsp;  
Anyways, I've written way more than I intended. Web development is fun, and I hope you enjoy it! :D
Start with the bare bones first, html is pretty easy to understand once you know the tags, then understand some css and then get into plain javascript. Javascript is a very big domain and you will find umpty number of frameworks. So get a grasp of vanilla javascript first and a bit of jquery. Then look into the ideologies behind frameworks and choose one. There's a lot to be learnt!
Have you thought about interning? If you like C++ and want to use this for web development, you may want to focus on Microsoft [Sharepoint](https://products.office.com/en-us/sharepoint/collaboration) development. Not real exciting but good for a stable  corporate gig.
Here's the video that will give brief overview of path you might want to take: http://youtu.be/pB0WvcxTbCA
One good option for networking is to go to local technical meetups and networking events. 

Once you get a few happy clients, they'll likely have more work for you *and* they'll (hopefully) recommend you to friends.
Start building credible portfolios by networking, It may seem like baby steps but once your clients appreciates your work they tend to recommend you to other who they think would be in need of your service. Good luck man!
I've never tried this but it sounds like a good idea. But aren't most people at these tech meetups also technical people/devs, rather than potential clients?
Probably varies depending on the meetup and what it's focus is. Some may be more technical - but have other freelancers who may be willing to refer work that comes their way if it's something they don't do, etc. Other meetups are geared more towards business owners or are just general "networking" meetups. 

It may also be worth looking into joining your local chamber of commerce and going to their events. Also, if you have access to an alumni network from school days, that can be useful.
https://www.reddit.com/prefs/#show_stylesheets

uncheck "allow subreddits to show me custom themes"
Why not just use RES and disable the stylesheet(s)?
fixing the real problems eh?
I did, however, I'm not always logged in.
I could, but I didn't. Tampermonkey allows me to install many other scripts for other sites. RES is reddit-specific.
Reddit's custom CSS might not be a worldwide catastrophe, but it has been a thorn in my side, and it's a personal problem I decided to solve. It's difficult to navigate the site when each subreddit looks different and places various buttons and links in different places.
oh

instead of using your script it would be more lightweight/efficient to use something like umatrix or ublock to block the stylesheet from loading in the first place
how do you even use the internet?
There are a million ways to skin a cat. This was my way.
Most websites use a consistent style and placement of important elements.
your retarded
TIL every website looks the same
> your retarded

Oh, the irony.
His retarded what?
Post some of the code to take a look at it!
This is why contracts exist - so you can find out what the client wants and bill accordingly. There's no defined answer.
Disclosure is assuming that this you're asking about a contractor setup. In case you're talking about more traditional employment, the answer still is similar: it depends on the company.

I've worked in places where the backend devs do the design (the quality of results are what you'd expect), places where designers stop at PSD and developers do the slicing and dicing, places where designers did their own slicing and dicing to HTML, and places that employed people whose only jobs were to slice and dice and liason between the designers and developers.

The more that you're *capable* of doing, the broader the range of jobs you can take on. If you want to stop at the PSD level and never learn anything else, your jobs will be more limited, but those jobs do absolutely exist.
Completely depends on the application and the contract.

In my experience, someone that manages just design isn't a developer, they're a designer. A front end developer is responsible for everything on the client, absolutely including forms and search submissions.
Thanks, but this isn't a situation I'm currently in. 

I was just wondering what the front end developer's responsibilities are from a technical standpoint 
It's still your answer. The developer's responsibilities are what you chose to include in a contract.
Hi Shaykyasin, your portfolio looks really solid. Great job porting the CodePen projects over to GitHub.io, also.

It looks like you executed all of Free Code Camp's required user stories for these project.

If you're done with the front end development certificate, I would keep pushing forward into the data visualization section.
Great job man. Did you start FreeCodeCamp with zero knowledge of web dev?
Thank you for kind words and for being an inspiration for the rest of us! Have a nice day!
I did learn some C in college, but my HTML/CSS was zero before FCC. All I know, I learned through their help. They're really good, and you should try if you haven't already. The community is really great and there are folks hanging out in gitter in case you need help.
A third option that would let you have even more time for you to concentrate on your business is Squarespace. It's a hosted cms. Not as flexible as Wordpress but much less to worry about. I love Wordpress but do you really want take care of hosting, maintenance, backups and security issues that come with it (or any CMS)?
If you're going to be a one-man-show, running your entire business, I don't see how you can possibly code everything from scratch. Based on your scenario, I'd recommend WordPress :)
If you're looking to write a blogging engine, then by all means, code from scratch.  But it sounds more like you're looking to write a blog, not a blogging engine.
Do you really want to spend your time writing a blog engine instead of developing your business ?
I've developed startup websites for almost 3 years now(some are for my friends, co-workers and some mutual friends as well, and some aspiring Technopreneurs)  and It seems like CMS are the way to go, especially Wordpress because if the flexibility and how the community support works, plus It's open-source and there are tons and millions of available free plugins to apply and be helpful on your site. The future users would also have an easier time learning to navigate through it. So, I'll recommend Wordpress and find some good templates to work on and tweak things out. Good luck man!

You can use this link: http://makeawebsitehub.com/
Yeah that is a pretty typical use case for wordpress.
Don't use WordPress. Use something like [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). If literally all you need is a static webpage do html and css, or if you want to maybe save yourself some trouble down the line aswell as learn a new skill use a templating engine like [handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com) and a style language like [sass](http://sass-lang.com)
I should be fine taking care of all the things you mention there. That is part of other research I am doing and looking at. I already know where I want to use for the domain (namesilo). Hosting is still relatively up in the air, since I see it is better to keep those separate. Or was it hosting and something else...I'll have to look back at my notes and saved sites.
Alrighty. Thank you. Should I stick with that indefinitely you think since I will be working on the game(s) and everything else?

Or if I ever actually hire employees, maybe consider creating one.
A blog is not what I want to do. More a site for the company with pages for the separate games and such. Like the normal "indie dev" company site.

So I do not want to write a blog or a blogging engine.
I do not want to write a blog or a blogging engine. I want to create a website for the company I will be starting.
Thank you sir. Definitely checking out that link.

Good to hear your experience along with recommendations. Gives it some weight, if that makes sense.
That's how it seems. I think I just wanted a little validation for not going the "from scratch" route, if that makes sense. 

Thank you.
I agree with you, don't know why you are getting downvoted. I have 2 similar sites to OP's, and all of them are just basic static sites that are written in jekyll. If I need to update something (the "dynamic" part of a CMS), I just update the source files, and push it to GitHub. 

However, next to jekyll I would also recommend taking a look at Tumblr. Many indie game developers have a blog there which allows you to build a small community around the game you are creating. And you can add pages to Tumblr as well (e. g. "About").
What does a templating engine do? The style language builds off of CSS basically, right?

I assume that would be more time consuming than using something like wordpress. 

What is the advantage of jekyll over wordpress and other similar things?
Nope you're correct: use separate companies for your domain and hosting.
IMO, I don't see the need to change from WordPress, but that's because I'm biased and love WordPress :)  I use it for my own site.
Ah, that's called a CMSâ€”Content Management System. In general, though, the line between blog and CMS is murky at best, and something like Wordpress can run the gamut.
There are other options, less heavy than word press. Word press has so many default features, login, database, dynamic content. If you have a simple company, using something simpler for adding your business solutions could be easier. Sorry I don't have anything onhand, but word press is really heavy for a one man show, considering you probably won't use it for it's intended use of having lots and lots of content, and adding dynamic content as needed + plugins.
So the handlebars in it's most basic form would allow you to take the common elements of your website (header, nav, footer, etc.) and turn them into reusable bits. Think of it like using php in the midst of your markup, like you would have to do for an advanced wordpress theme. You could set up your server to generate the static pages dynamically whenever a request comes in, or you could do it all in bulk and be left with a bunch of static html pages all setup to go into an amazon s3 bucket for cheep hosting.

Yes SASS or in it's better form SCSS is basically a language that extends css to allow you to set variables for reused colors for example, or widths. It's much more powerful than that when you get into creating mixins.

Advantages of jekyll over wordpress IMO are:
- it generates static html and can be hosted freely using github pages, or very cheaply using an amazon s3 bucket.
- setup to write content in markdown
- you're not nearly as vulnerable (wordpress vulnerabilities are the first thing any bots check)
- arguably simpler than wordpress to extend to how you like

Hope that helps
Ok. Thank you. One other thing. I recall something about DNS being a separate thing you need to pay for or something. Is that right?
Ah. Well that's fair :)
Cool. Sounds like a really good option. Then if I ever decide to expand it or revamp or something,  I can try my hand at making one from scratch or start with some sort of template or something. 
That's no problem. It's a good comment. Wonder if I should make a post elsewhere/search for something for a good website creation tool or something. Maybe ask a few other indie game devs.
It definitely does. Thank you. More things to consider haha.
Your hosting will provide you with instructions. But it should be just logging into your domain account and point the dns to your host -- my domain knowledge isn't great though. I think you're thinking of CDN like Cloudflare - with you probably don't need unless you anticipate a ton of traffic. I'm no expert though.
I may have been thinking domain was completely separate from DNS and you needed an additional thing for it.

You can also get more than just site links to show up, like a search box or an image, with [Structured Data Markup](https://developers.google.com/structured-data/)
You can also use Google's tags in your html to style them, but it's up to Google whether they get shown or not.

https://developers.google.com/structured-data/
Essentially, by being a really popular site. They are auto-generated by Google's algorithms.
use [Google Site Links](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/47334?hl=en)
The biggest thing to consider is if you aren't in the top three (though I don't think I've ever seen it unless it's #1) that this data won't ever get shown. Optimizing this stuff can be a major time suck, so it's important to decide whether it's worth the time investment or not, relative to your rankings on keywords you are targeting. 
Not the right sidebar really, I know this can be done through Google My Business. But is the results output something that I can control?
As mentioned. [structured data markup](https://developers.google.com/structured-data/) is what you're looking for. I've also found that [Google Webmasters](https://www.google.com/webmasters) also has similar and very useful tools for improving search presence.
You can't

Even if you supply them all the structured mark up in the world, unless they think you are important they won't do it.
The answer has already been provided, but something else you might like to investigate if you're looking into this type of thing is open graph. This is used to determine what your content will look like when shared to social media.
This is the most useful answer here.
Hey look the correct answer. UPVOTE

> Google Site Links

You can't specify the sitelinks to use, though you can 'demote' the ones you don't want to show up through Google Search Console.
`meta` tags, like `description` let Google know your preference, then add relevant content on each page to reenforce that. This may be ignored, however in preference of site content.

Use OpenGraph tags to increase the presence of these phrases on other sites for Google to cross-reference (Facebook and Twitter are the most obvious).

Use a sitemap to get those sub-links. Get it into Bing and Google.

Configure Google Analytics, Google WebMaster Tools, Search Console, etc.

Use semantic HTML on your homepage so it can get accurate data (beyond `h1` and `h2`, add `header` and `nav` elements to accurately describe your site). Remember that it's a robot scanning your site and making its best guess. It's pretty good at guessing, but this should clear up any confusion.

Beyond semantic HTML, use schema.org markup so Google can go a step further with the data on your site. We do this for restaurants and other businesses we build sites for to make sure there is an accurate, searchable, indexable version of the content available to search engines.
What exactly has been lost by Reddit in OP's image? A visit to the homepage before hopefully stumbling into one of the listed popular subs? No. All this does is expose users to more parts of your site but more importantly, takes up a larger area of the search results. Doing this is known to increase views. Similar to how companies buy ads on very obvious results. For example google "Mercedes". Everything above the fold is the same site for me.
[deleted]
That's a valid concern I guess, but the time that's most useful is when it's a Google Now response. I can't really see it being applied to all types of sites. If you run some sort of wiki or FAQ site it's probably bad news though.
If a user is able to get all they need from your site in a micro preview, maybe your site isn't worth visiting in the first place...
I started with PHP but still looked into other languages in my spare time and down time. So even if you start in a PHP job there is nothing stopping you looking into other languages and creating/developing projects you wanted in your spare time.
The react + rails apprenticeship sounds like a fantastic opportunity. 
I would go with what you think you would enjoy more. PHP has been around for a long time and probably isn't going anywhere. It's not hard to pick up new languages if you already know how to program.
Both are good to have in pocket, but you should definitely do the local market research, because for example in my country there's around 5 companies that work with Rails and even less who works with React, so unless you are freelance do the research and make decision based on that. That said I would PHP as the starting point. Good luck.
How you think is more important than the language you write. You can do whichever sounds more fun and know you can pick up another language quickly based on your experience. 
I have a friend who manages a team of devs writing SPC software. They switched to python from I don't remember what, but his whole team was back to normal output in a month.
I don't think any employer will be surprised if you started your first job with PHP, the language that powers 80% of the internet.
I already know Rails and several other things but it seems like the majority of jobs have steered away from php or at least in my area.  That's why I fear becoming trapped in a fading ecosystem (again in my area not everywhere) 
[deleted]
It seems like php jobs are fading away in my area which is the concern.  Everyone wants rails and node
64.329%
I've had quite the opposite experience. I chose PHP because of it's longevity and the abundance of jobs available (both local and online). You could probably specialize in Wordpress alone and make a career out of it.  
  
I think a lot of what you might be seeing stems from startups, who generally have higher turnover, choosing to use a newer "sexier" languages, regardless of whether it's best suited for what they need.
Exactly this.  We had a guy come in (php job) for an interview and he was a typical hipster coder.  Job posting clearly stated it was PHP. He came in and said "Pfft. You guys STILL use PHP? We could do this in rails".

Yeah sure buddy, let's revamp our system we've been using for decades and updating for a language we don't need, that won't give us any difference in delivery.  Needless to say he lost out on the job because of his dick attitude and lack of open-mindedness. That, and he couldn't explain how multidimensional arrays worked. 
Ignorance like this seems to be fairly rampant, and usually indicates lack of experience.  
  
[Without question there are superior languages, but only in relation to what you're trying to accomplish.](http://benchmarksgame.alioth.debian.org/u64/index.html)
Yup, like so: https://codepen.io/anon/pen/gPxYja

I didn't include the various vendor prefixes, but you should be able to get the idea.

To made it "reverse" when you mouseout, add `transition: all 500ms ease-out 0s` to the `.box` class.

Add a transition effect with a delay of 500ms (or whatever you want) to the `.box:hover p` to control how/when the paragraph text appears. Also change the `p` block from being hidden with `display: none;` to `opacity: 0`.

About that last point, do realize the difference between display and opacity. Display will remove that element from the page completely and it wont take up any space. Opacity simply hides it but keeps the space of the element there.
Does this solve the issues for you? http://codepen.io/anon/pen/ZQJYEz
I'm not sure about that opacity thing, i'm thinking of having a few of these line up vertically and then when you hover over a box the box extends and gives some information about the subject. Wouldnt the opacity make so that the boxes would be placed far apart from each other?

And thank you very much for the help with my struggles :D
Actually these work perfectly!

Thank you so much! :D
Actually might not be a problem: https://codepen.io/anon/pen/gPxYja. The box is there in the DOM and you can see the space is given to it if you mouse over that element, but the next box below it just goes right on top of it. Should be fine.
No problem.
I tried applying it to the website i'm playing with. Seems like the p tag or something is interrupting the cursor hover area. I also noticed it in your Codepen. When you hover over the title the box above might open instead of the box you're hovering over.

Is there any way to solve this problem?
I'm not aware of a way to tell CSS to *only* affect the current mouseover element when you use class specifiers (though I'd love to be proved wrong). I think you'd either have to give each element a unique id/class or use jQuery.
I'm not really experienced with Jquery, only copied some sliders from the internet. Is it easy to solve this with JQuery? If so, i'd really love to know how.
Take a look at this one: https://codepen.io/anon/pen/LGjYmG. There are some oddities (like if you move your mouse over one of them quickly), but that's the general idea. I also set the margin of the `h2`s to 0 since that was causing some jumping around as it animated.

Now unless someone else comes in and says that doing this in CSS is possible, I'd suggest jQuery if you are planning on having lots of elements to hover over. If you're only going to have a couple, then giving them unique class/ids isn't that difficult and you could do it all just using CSS.


I'm planning on having 6 boxes like this one after each other, maybe i'll use CSS just because thats something i can understand :)

Thanks for the help mate!
I'm very sorry to hear about your situation. I can imagine how unsatisfying, stressful, and unhappy it can be. While I don't know all the particulars of your situation, here are some general thoughts.

All jobs can be tough, especially at first - and it's important to make sure you're considering leaving only when you've tried to make it work (unless it's unsalvageable), including:

- Talk to your manager about ways you could work on the things you're excited about
- Find another team or project to work on at the company
- Suggest a project that you could get excited about and that would substantially help your company
- Ask to work with the mobile outsource team
- For your "fitting in" comment: I don't know how you're not fitting in - but decide if it's unbridgeable or not

For looking for a new job:

- I don't often recommend quitting a job without having something else ready, so I'd do my best to look while you're at this job (I know that's not easy and can be time consuming)
- A good way to find a job is not always a recruiter, but a place whether great engineers you know work (or want to work)
- Think about your previous poor job experiences, and what things you could have done beforehand to reduce the risk (e.g., ask questions in an interview, ask to do a one week trial, have a long conversation with your manager on your role)
- Don't over-optimize on most frameworks (especially things like front end frameworks or build tools), as these can change quickly - but do over-optimize on finding engineers you respect and can learn from
- Potentially look for good contracting roles, where the company is growing, and could see hiring you eventually (which helps you better understand if that's a company you want to work for)
- Also, think about working on good open source projects; it can help you differentiate yourself and also grow your skills/network

I don't know if you're early in your career (you said years of 'crap jobs', so probably not), but I'll reiterate something I say to most junior devs. Don't optimize salary in your first jobs compared to learning, working on interesting problems, and the network you gain. In many cases, this is much more valuable long term than the salary difference.

(Others, feel free to pipe in)
I know that feel bro, I'm in the exact situation as you are now, I've worked with Hosting servers, Domains, Site security, Open-source, CMS development and so on. But guess what? I'm now just stuck with small site revisions like paddings, margins, image resizing and all those small corrections, It pays more than my previous job. I am just waiting for a new opportunity to get back on track, But on the brightside, I get to have more freetime since I finish the jobs/tasks earlier than expected so I get to work on my freelance jobs which is more challenging than my full-time job. Hang in there man, better things are coming your way. :D
I'm unsure if there's a better way to do it as it's been some time since I've worked with this api, but you need to create some js to loop through all the elements in the JSON data and create and place map markers on the map.

You can see an example [here](http://snippetrepo.com/snippets/multiple-markers-using-json-with-google-maps-api)

They are using "new google.maps.LatLng" to create a point, "new google.maps.Marker" to create a marker from that point and assign to a map on the page, and "new google.maps.InfoWindow" to create the popup window for clicking and getting marker information.
Here's a working example using OPs jsfiddle (with only a small amount of the JSON data): https://jsfiddle.net/L3pcs1h3/2/. Note the `for` loop at the very end of the code section.
I believe op would only need to add a search box that restricts the viewing area to some radius centered around the searched location and this would do it.
This helps a ton! I guess I was overthinking it and trying to import the JSON doc into a separate JS file. But this makes sense. Thanks for making the fiddle as a bonus!
It's becoming fairly common to use S3 for storage. It has its own upload API, and then it's just a matter of your code giving users the right shortcuts to download such files.
I'll have to look up S3. At the moment I rent from OVH and $0.011/mo/Gb seems insanely cheap but it's public although I was assured wouldn't be noticeable. This is unmanaged too. But I'm interested in this and more than likely will implement it as default standard.
It would be nice if the user could change how they are paid [Hourly, Weekly, Bimonthly, Monthly]. Otherwise it looks clean and simple.
Help the user more up front. Eg. "Monthly Income" instead of "Income" as a heading, same for "Monthly Expenses" instead of "Expenses". Remove the word "monthly" from the tool-tips, as it applies to everything; otherwise it makes the user think some items might be different to the rest.

Some input boxes have strange positioning, eg: http://i.imgur.com/75W9o5n.gif

The up/down buttons are superfluous, remove them for simplicity. The user is going to type in the amounts anyway, so the up/down buttons won't help anything.

Highlight the input box when the focus is on it, so the user can TAB down and easily see where what the current input is.

I'd place the "Budget" section on the right, non-scrolling area, under the pie chart and make the pie chart always visible. Making it always visible helps the user know what to expect from the page. When it suddenly appeared, my first thought was "what did I do to make that come up?" which is a distraction - don't "surprise" the user.

You can easily compress everything so it all fits on one page without scrolling, especially with the "Budget" area on the right. Then it is a bit more logical - input on left, output on right, pie chart visible = easy for user to grok at a glance. No scrolling.

Basically I'd arrange it roughly as so: http://i.imgur.com/t0FCyrw.png

Fix the content width so it doesn't spread out so wide, and make it centered. User can add & remove income and expense items, and that will adjust the coloured legend on the right of course. Save each change using Ajax to a database and you have something a user can come back to later.

ed: As you may have noticed, I didn't see the need for "savings" and "emergency fund". :) It's most useful as an income/expense calculator. The user should already know what they have in the bank. I would add another expense item though, called "Savings", which is how much the user wants to \*save\* (put away) every month. And, instead of "Budget" as the last calculated item, maybe put "Remaining" or "Discretionary" or something - which is how much the user has to "play with" after expenses and saving.
Viewing on my phone: there's nothing to indicate that it wants weekly values. I'm used to a monthly budget and realized I was doing it wrong when I saw the bottom.
Cool, just got confused whether to input weekly wage or monthly wage and whether to input weekly expenses or monthly.
I would maybe add something about taxes? The only reason I say this is because I initially put down what I actually bring home a month in the "income" section, but when I look at the "budget" section my annual income was way off. This is because what I bring home and budget around is not what I actually am paid. 
I plan on adding more more features, but the income options are one of them, and a way to add more rows of expenses/savings/income
I'm going to rearrange the site as you said, I like your layout better.
I'm a bit confused why does the site look that way, I have no problems on my end. What browser are you using? The input boxes are totally normal.

But I feel like there will be scrolling, I can't tell what every users resolution will be, but I guess I should start with a base of 1024x768 or 1366x768 to be able to view all content in one page.

As far as the savings is concerned, that is what the savings section is for. Its for your monthly contributions to savings, it counts as an expense. Its not how much is in your account. At the bottom of the budget section, it shows how much you'd save if you contributed that amount.
Sorry about that. I get paid weekly so I adjusted it for that, but I should change it since everything else is monthly and logic dictates it would be monthly if everything is monthly.
Another helpful feature would be to save the data from use to use. You could do this with cookies.
I agree. I've been wanting to make a budget site for ages so I love seeing this. I like the simplicity of the design, but I think you'd gain a lot by giving users the ability to add and remove categories.
A lot of people are paid an hourly wage, that translates to sometimes 8 hours a day, sometimes 10. It needs to have more options in terms of customization.
localStorage :)
I plan on adding way to add more rows of expenses/savings/income later on. I just wanted it to be up for now

I would hate to have to resort to Wordpress to use a plugin -- is there an easier and cleaner way to incorporate simple voting into a site?
Wow you're right! This might be the perfect solution since people love using strawpoll. Thanks!

Edit: Can Strawpolls be created dynamically?
I can quickly code the front end for you, if you have a way to handle the data storage on the back end. I could do if for you even if you don't...
Yes, they can

https://github.com/strawpoll/strawpoll/wiki/API
Thank you for that generous offer.

Is there a site that can automatically handle the data storage? I can probably try to figure out how to do it all in PHP but I'm wondering if there is an easier solution.
Thanks!
Honestly, I have no clue. I think if it's not too complex, then you can use Google Sheets as a limited server; might work for your application...
Yes, firebase was made for this.
https://css-tricks.com/using-svg/
https://github.com/willianjusten/awesome-svg
I can recommend two books for you:

SVG Essentials - Eisenberg; O'Reilly

Building Web Applications with SVG - Dailey, Frost, Strazzullo; MS Press
This is not too tricky

* Make sure you have the following columns in your `users` table `id``security_hash``validated`
* User registers, enter details into your users table set `validated` to `0`. 
* Generate a hash. Use some random variables like the time, their ID, their username anything really, but use a couple.
* Save the hash in your users table with their other stuff
* Create a link to a php function that takes a hash and user ID as arguments and mail it to the user

your link will look something like this:

*yoursite.com*/*pathToFunction*/*hash*/*userId*

Then in your function, lookup the users `id` with the `userId` in the link and compare the hashes. If they match Switch `validated` to `1` then null out the hash.

If you just want to send a thank you e-mail, you can send an AJAX call to a PHP file.

    $to = $_POST['email'];
    $from = 'youremail@whatever.com';
    $subject = 'Thanks for signing up!';
    $message .= $_POST["name"] . ', thanks for signing up!';
    $headers = "From: $from";
    @mail($to, $subject, $message, $headers);

I'm not suggesting to use this exact, insecure script, but it is one method.
Why are you using a hash?  If I know how you build it, there's no security to it; and it's being stored anyway, just make something actually random.  A guid seems better; just give it to them in the URL, save it, and check it when it's given back.  The hash (or whatever) probably shouldn't be part of the user table.  It's useless after confirmation, so migh as well use a lookup table and delete the record after confirmation.

What is pathToFunction in the URL?  The path on disk?  Don't expose implementation details to the client.  I can't think of a reason to do this.  It's going to always be the same thing, right?
This allows anyone to use your server to send a huge amount of spam. They would just send their own collection of stolen email addresses to your script one by one as $_POST['email'] while using $_POST['name'] to enter their own message, including HTML links to their spammy sites, followed by 50 line breaks to push down the ", thanks for signing up!" bit.

And yes, spammers are using crawlers that are actively looking for this type of exploitable stuff.
Ehhhhh that's a scary thought. Someone could easily start spamming if there's no bot prevention.
That's some XSS vulnerabilities right there too.
> Why are you using a hash?

To create a unique link for each user that registers. 



> If I know how you build it, there's no security to it;

In production I would also add a time limit of a couple of hours. Care to explain how you would guess the hash and the users ID between a user registering and verifying? 



> it's being stored anyway, just make something actually random.

Do you not class a hash of their IP, the time, their username and their user ID random? And it's only stored until they have verified then its `null`



> A guid seems better; just give it to them in the URL, save it, and check it when it's given back.

How is this not what I'm doing? I'm using a random hash as a guid.



> What is *pathToFunction* in the URL? The path on disk?



No it's the path from the webroot. So `var/www/puplic_html/mysite/verifiy.php` becomes `mysite.com/verifiy.php` 

This makes the function open to anyone with the url but it won't run without the arguments one of which is a random hash then other an unknown ID. Another reason to use a hash.



>  I can't think of a reason to do this.

Hopefully I've cleared things up for you.


> It's going to always be the same thing, right?

Nope, its a completely different link for each user. Thanks to the hash.
>The system uses a software called Jekyll to generate and maintain the static files, and itâ€™s easy to use. You can learn about Jekyll here, but in the meantime, think of it like WordPress for the command line.

What? You can use *any* static site generator with github pages, not just Jekyll. Another good example would be Metalsmith or Hexo.
I didn't realize this is what github was. I'm assuming this isn't just for coding and can be used for all kinds of files? I'm a freshman design student and this would be killer for group projects and collabs. Thanks a boatload for the post to the article!
XPost Subreddit Link: /r/programming 

Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/40na0y/github_the_beginners_guide/
I'm subbed to /r/TheBeginnersGuide, and I thought this was Davey posting the source on Github, lol.
So I'll admit it, I'm a front end dev who's never used github.  At work we use svn for version tracking.  I would love to get into versioning in my home / freelance projects, that could act like a backup as well.  Do you freelancers use github for your stuff, even if its not a collaboration?  Just feels wrong to me putting a freelance project into a public repo...
i am mostly a web designer, if i upload my html/css/js to a github do i store the whole project like img folder as well?
i'm just trying to figure out how to make it relevent to me
This is true, However this is targeted to beginners. Since Github seems to favor Jekyll [This](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/) and it is mentioned on the homepage of [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com) then why confuse a beginner with lots of options?
Non-diffable file formats and large files can really struggle with a lot of VCS. It's still probably worth it, but you'll lose some of the features that make VCS great.

Though github/perforce/almost everybody else in VCS are all pouring a lot of effort into supporting more and more formats with their whole range of features.
As a student, you can get a free account with 5 private repos: [https://education.github.com/pack](https://education.github.com/pack)

I think you might need an .edu email address, but I'm not certain about that.
That's unfortunate haha :)
Bittbucket is an alternative to github with free private repositories, although as a result it lacks the community and support of github. 
Git can still be useful even if you keep everything local on your machine. You still get the benefits of branching, diffing, rolling back to past commits, etc.
For freelance and a nice graphical interface like github I'd recommend checking out [Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com). However you should learn GIT in the command line if your are going to run your own git repo's locally or behind the firewall. I wouldn't put any freelance work up in a public repo. Especially because Github requires all public repos to be Open Source licensed.
Would definitely not put freelance projects into a public repo
I use bitbucket for private stuff as well
>  Do you freelancers use github for your stuff, even if its not a collaboration?

Absolutely. Always use version control.

However, I wouldn't make any project public unless it's built to be shared. I use Bitbucket because they give me unlimited private repos. And also because I use Mercurial instead of Git.
One place that I worked, I simply used git-svn and it worked pretty well. Whenever it failed, all I had to do was simply push again and it worked.
Typically you'd store any assets including code, images, CSS, Javascript, etc. in git(Github). If the assets are avaliable using a package manager like bower then a lot of the time people will just add a Grunt or Gulp script to add them locally once the person pulls down the files from your repo.

If you need any of that explained more simply just say. :)
Yup. Put everything *except* secrets (passwords, API keys) and generated files under version control.
I understand not wanting to confuse beginners, but the information is completely false. Instead of saying it's the only option, maybe it would be better to say it's the most popular?
For group projects, google docs is one of the best because of its real-time collab, but you probably already knew that. Otherwise, using a VCS for non-diffable files is pretty much the same as using Box/OneDrive/Dropbox/whatever, except with more headache.

Dropbox saves file revision history on everything for 30 days anyway, even for free accounts.
As long as I can get the adobe formats up there, I'll be good!
https://help.github.com/articles/versioning-large-files/
Does github's LFS do any diffing or does it just check the hash and either keep or replace? 
Do we need to get our school to verify our .edu address?
Good to know, I will check it out!
And Gitlab is another that is also partially open source.
Great info, I'll check out Gitlab.  I'm not afraid of the command line by any means, just never felt worth running a local git as my freelance stuff is relatively small.
Well, github has a feature that builds jekyll for you, maybe that's why he's saying that 
>For group projects, google docs is one of the best because of its real-time collab, but you probably already knew that

Slack is way better for this.
Git LFS is a way to get git to work at all. It's still not a great solution. It just happens to be a mediocre solution on a good platform in a field of other not great solutions on ok platforms.

Perforce is still way better if you're going to have a significant amount of non-mergable/diffable binary files. Git LFS brings it up to par with SVN insomuch that binary files no longer totally kill your repo, but it will still struggle once you get to merging as there's not really a good way to stop people from overwriting changes if multiple people start working on the same file at the same time.

As far as github is concerned their prices also aren't that great for LFS vs. alternatives the last time I checked.
When I did it, I just signed up for a Github account with my .edu address and afterwards followed the steps in that link I posted. There was never any confirmation with the school as far as I know, at least not anything I was a part of.
If you're considering running your own Git server (to keep your work on multiple machines. Since git is local, you don't otherwise need a server) I suggest you also look into Gogs. It's a more "young" project, but I've had good luck with it so far. Plus, it's coded in Go, so I believe it's perfectly cross-platform.
Slack is a chat app, no?
Totally not better. It's like apples and oranges. There is no way to organize it well. You cannot replace chat system with document storage/archiving system.
You can upload code, store or share files, have rooms to real-time collab/discuss projects in..
I real time collaboration in the context of Google Docs means more than one guy can edit a file at the same time. Slack can't do that.
Ah, alright. Dont really know of any webdev projects where I would want to edit a file at the same exact time as someone else in Google Docs. I use Google Docs for making spreadsheets and excel files on the fly to share with others or clients.

For work we use Github, Slack, Skype, irc for working together.
I would just make the font a bit darker, but I love the minimalistic styling!
I click Contact and see nothing ... until I scroll down. Each item should show up in the same spot IMO.
Regular selection/highlight blue doesn't look good with your font color.
Trying to highlight text in any page other than the right-most highlights text from the right-most, instead. 
I've developed startup websites for almost 3 years now(some are for my friends, co-workers and some mutual friends as well, and some aspiring Technopreneurs)  and It seems like CMS are the way to go, especially Wordpress because if the flexibility and how the community support works, plus It's open-source and there are tons and millions of available free plugins to apply and be helpful on your site. 
I really like simple sites like yours, I'd suggest you to create the same site by using Angular or React in order to gain new skills on web development.
Fair point, i'll definitely adapt that. Yeah I guess that's kind of 'my thing'; I've never been able to get massively in to graphic design or anything a long those lines, so instead have just created styles around minimalism and stripping things down to the raw basics, which IMO looks so much better than cluttered alternatives. Thank you!
Each section should show up in the viewport without scrolling, so thanks for pointing that bug out, i'll make some changes so scrolling isn't necessary!
By regular section do you mean that the website opens 'About', for example, when loaded rather than the content side being blank? I'll definitely change the highlight colour. Thank you!
I'd never considered that when choosing how to set the site up! This should be a simple fix (no idea why i didn't do it anyway looking back now) that i'll get on to right away. Thank you!
I've had a small look at WordPress but never really got any further than 'a brief look', so maybe I should try and learn about it and other CMS a bit more!
Angular is definitely something I'm interested in learning, so when I've finished my exams I reckon that'll be the next thing on my list. I've never considered React so thanks for the suggestion, I'll have a look in to it!
sure thing, good luck!
Sit 1 meter (3 feet?) from your computer screen, squint. You now read the way a 60y old person does. If you can still read it you should be fine.
I meant the default selection color doesn't look good with that gray font color you're using. But if you're not on a big iMac screen, you'll have to scroll with some of that right side content. Why not just have each section at the top of the page?
Yes, and since you like playing with CSS, it should be a breeze. Once you get the hang of it in editing the usual html files converting them to Wordpress. Have fun man. Liked your minimalist site btw, I'm hoping there would be graphics further ahead in the development. 
Ah okay, I understand now. Yeah that seems to be the biggest issue that's been mentioned. On a big screen it's good, on a mobile it's okay, but something in the middle and the design/experience isn't up to scratch. Thanks again! 
Hi guys, I'm Yoav, one of the creators of Coverr.co, it's live for 6 months already and we keep uploading videos.
They are all optimized to be background videos - both in type of cinematography but also in the 3 different formats (ogv,webm & mp4) as well as image.

Glad to see you guys appreciate it, we will keep uploading more videos there. 
There are so many. But not specific for background videos. Nearly all are usable for background videos. 

Shutterstock is one of them. Just Google for 'video stock' and you'll find enough. 
I knew this was hiding in my bookmarks somewhere:

http://coverr.co/

I think this is, or is pretty damn close to, what you're searching for.
Yeah the specific one I'm thinking of had the videos rendered for web performance as well as provided code. It was like a year ago and the website was just starting up. I've been unable to find it.
Now I'm curious. Maybe searching for 'webm stock videos' would help. 
Well now I feel like an idiot... I had it as a bookmark:

http://coverr.co/
If you don't have versions of IE available, you can download VMs from microsoft for free - https://dev.windows.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/vms/

It's a z-index issue. `.dl-menuwrapper` has a higher z-index than the `.sponsors` so when you try to click the sponsor icons, you're actually clicking on links in the `#menu-dropdown` list.
I actually tried the virtual machine thing, but it IE wasn't popping up on it. Just paint, excel, and word lol. But thanks a ton, hopefully this solves the issue for them!
I generally use namecheap only for domain registration.

I would recommend looking into some sort of auto-scaling cloud host to get you up and running for now. Avoid rackspace but do look at Google cloud hosting and others like Amazon AWS.

Once you get a feel for your resource usage you can look into switching to a VPS.
Hey, I work at Namecheap and you can contact our support team. We'll walk you through everything. I would start with shared hosting to start though and scale up (buy more) as you need it!
If you have a small scale site, I would recommend getting their shared hosting, I have mine for like 2-3 years now, It is also useful if you have multiple domain names. It would be cheaper and efficient IMO. I have a wordpress site and one forum site. So it suits my needs. 
> auto-scaling cloud host 

Honestly man I have no clue what that means, sorry lol. I'm a noob when it comes to all this.
I went onto the live chat and asked the person a few questions and all they practically told me was "go and look at the sections yourself."  
  
Of course I know how to look at the options you offer. But the reason I contacted them was to find out what the benefits of each option is since I have no clue on what the likes of shared hosting is.  
  
Do you think you could maybe help me out? Thanks.
It allocates more resources as it needs to and you get billed accordingly
This stuff is pretty technical, so I'll try to rephrase it in an analogy:

Say you own a food truck. Running the food truck costs money. You only serve 1000 people per day reliably, but *some* days 5000 people show up, but since the line is so long, most leave before getting food. Now, you could buy 5 trucks, and lose a bunch of money most days but take advantage of the *some* days when 5000 people came OR you could sign up for an "auto scaled food truck", where you pay for the 1 food truck that serves 1000 people, but once 800 people are in line, it's smart enough to magically conjure a 2nd, identical food truck to serve the potential load. This allows you to take advantage of high loads without paying for the infrastructure. Of course, you had to pay for that 2nd food truck when it was conjured, but you don't need to pay for it *all the time*. Thats the key.

In this analogy, the server is the food truck. it "serves" people your application. You shouldn't spend the money on a server that is capable of serving 20-30000 people, because frankly, you probably wont see those numbers consistently, at least not in the beginning. An auto-scaling server will allow you to keep your infrastructure costs low, while taking advantage of "surges" in which your application suddenly has thousands of concurrent users.

Let me know if that made any sense :)
Honestly, you need to hire someone that knows what they are doing.
shared hosting means they will put you on a server with other websites.  This is great because the group of you are paying together for the server and thus making it cheaper for everyone.  The downside is, if one of these sites gets attacked, hit by a huge amount of traffic, etc.  it could potentially slow down or disrupt your site completely.   Shared hosting is generally for anyone who doesnt need to guarantee 100% uptime, is hosting something smaller (a generic website), and doesn't intend to go viral or huge anytime soon.  
Just be careful because a lot of the autoscaling groups don't work quite the way you expect them to and require priming. 
You explained it perfectly man.  
  
How exactly would I know I'm being charged the right amount when the numbers rise/fall? I assume a company like NameCheap will always charge me the right amount since they're a reputable company?  
  
  
And because I reach 3-5 million people per week on my Facebook pages, I'm hoping I can drive a fair amount of that traffic to my site. But if the plan you mentioned allows for expansion that would be great. It'll just be worrying me because I won't know how much I'll have to pay every month.
Also, do you know how much I'd have to pay per month for hosting on NameCheap to make sure I can withstand 30,000 - 50,000 visitors per month along with my site remaining safe too?  
  
I'd like to know 'cause if it's not too much, I wouldn't mind paying it.
Well I'm currently reaching 3-5 million people per week on my Facebook pages and I hope to get 10,000 - 50,000 hits per month on my site, hopefully more if possible. 
Hmm yeah, it sounds like you do have the potential for that many visitors. I'm sorry for discrediting it off the bat, it's just that most people with a fancy new idea believe that they will have thousands and thousands of visitors. In your case, it sounds like you have a proven viewer base, which is awesome.

With regards to knowing exactly how much it *should* cost, I can't help too much since I don't have any personal experience hosting a site/app beyond the "free tier" of hosting services. That being said, you should definitely consult someone with the knowledge/experience since if you do sign up for the wrong service you could end up spending more money than you need to. However, I'm sure namecheap, AWS, microsoft Azure, google hosting etc, are all transparent and reliable in their billing. Avoid GoDaddy; I hear they are shady.

Estimating costs can be difficult because it largely depends on the type of site/app you will be hosting. Most of these cloud services bill based on computation time. this means that a web app that has a lot of background computation (like facebook) will cost a LOT more than a "static website" (which would be a simple website like buzzfeed or wikipedia). Depending on which side of the spectrum your site sits on, will have a drastic effect on cost. If I'm not mistaken, cloud-hosting for static sites can be <100$ /month even while serving a lot of people... but don't quote me on that ;)
In that case, go with a VPS. Also, feel free to ask for a supervisor if you feel stuck. Sorry for the trouble!
Thing is that hosting requirements can vary pretty drastically based on what technologies are used, whether or not the site content very dynamic (always changing) and/or allows lots of user generated content. If it's just a simple page with lots of static/cache-able content a shared hosting plan can handle a good amount of traffic.

10K - 50K hits a month is a very small website, something that pretty much any hosting provider/package can handle with ease. But I suspect you might be mixing up terminology. "Hits" are generally considered to be every request made against a server... The content, each image, any scripts, CSS files etc... A single page visit could yield dozens to hundreds of hits.

Based on the facebook reach, I suspect you mean 10 - 50K visitors/sessions a month which is still quite small and well within what I'd consider shared hosting territory unless you need more processing/memory/database capacity. 
It's all good man. I also know what it takes to write articles that have a better chance at going viral.  
  
I remember I made a Blogger page for a joke 3 years ago and within a week I got a post that hit almost 500,000 views lol. But obviously it's not always as easy as that.  
  
Thanks for your help man, I really do appreciate it.  
Should I buy a year of the 'value' shared hosting on NameCheap and see what happens? I'm sure if need be I can upgrade it but I assume that'd be more than enough starting off?  
  
Also, I live in the UK but my fanbase includes everyone from the U.S, UK, South Africa, Paris, etc.  
  
I assume I'd need to select the 'UK datacenter?' And it'd still be a fast site for everyone no matter where they are in the world?
What are you trying to do with the Website? Just serving content as in Blog posts with text and some pictures? Or do you require your visitors do create accounts, login, "do" stuff with "services" you provide?

You're very welcome my friend, best of luck!
I don't use namecheap for hosting, I run my own dedicated hardware... But I suspect there's not a huge capacity difference between the plans. They all offer "unlimited" bandwidth. 

If the value package offers enough disk space and includes all the other features you need, I don't see a problem with starting there. As for which data center, generally best to pick the one closest to where most of your audience will be browsing from. If 80% of your fans are American, hosting it in the US makes sense... But realistically this isn't a big concern for small websites.

If site performance becomes an issue you can look into something like cloudflare which will cache and serve your website content globally.

It's going to be a hip hop blog but I plan to add a merchandise store to it a few months into it, and I'll also be adding the likes of videos to it and of course photos. 
Bootstrap are all the tools to build the house.  It comes with components pre-built out of the box, pre-styled forms, a responsive grid, and many other neat features that make your life easier when building out websites.  

However, I would NEVER recommend someone just learning to jump into Bootstrap.  You will want to learn CSS first, and it's quite easy in comparison to other challenges you will face.  Once you have a solid understanding of CSS, how it works, some of the hacks developed over time, and the little gotcha's you will surely face - move on to a framework like Bootstrap or Foundation.  

Jumping into Bootstrap will give you instant gratification because you will spin up a nice looking website very quickly, but you wont have learned much beyond how to copy/past some Bootstrap sample code into a text editor. 
I wouldn't really call Bootstrap a shortcut, but more of a foundation that you build upon. There's actually a similar framework called Foundation (which I prefer), but they're both very similar. There are dozens of frameworks out there, but I'd say Bootstrap and Foundation are the most commonly used ones. These frameworks are useful in giving you the building blocks of what you need for a website (columns, grid systems, media queries). You could build these things from scratch, but personally I like to use a framework because it saves so much time. If I were you, I'd start with a framework, then you could backwards engineer it to see how it works. Go with Bootstrap if that's the one they're teaching you in the lessons. Hope this helps!
This book gave me an awesome base:

http://www.amazon.com/Smarter-Way-Learn-HTML-CSS/dp/150867387X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1452623383&sr=8-1&keywords=a+smarter+way+to+learn+jquery

I would highly recommend it if you're just starting out.
Frameworks like Bootstrap, Foundation and Skeleton have grid components that can make your life a bit easier when it comes to positioning things across all browsers/devices. It's annoying to constantly do that on your own. That said, you should know how to do that relatively well before using one if you want to learn front end.
Learn CSS first, then move onto bootstrap. 

I see this all of the time with jQuery/JS. People want to learn jQuery before they learn the fundamentals of JS.

A framework/library can be very helpful, but knowing the fundamentals will help you more in the long run.

I started with Bootstrap and jQuery because my previous job told me to (bad idea). After spending a lot of time outside work teaching myself CSS/LESS and vanilla JS, I understood how Bootstrap and jQuery actually worked, and I was also able to determine when and when not to use them.
You can learn them both at the same time. As you start using the bootstrap classes just peak into the classes actual CSS and you'll catch on pretty quick. Get the site running and play with them in developer mode.
Bootstrap is nice but to be honest I don't often use all of it so it adds extra overhead. Some of the time a simple grid system is all you need. You should learn how a CSS grid works and how to make your own.
This is awesome, I appreciate the replies! I can't wait to get this experience on a role and make a career out of it.
Start from the basics man, I mean the real foundations. Say for example, CSS. How it works, all of its properties, possible tweaks etc. Theres more to learn on this, but If you'll go straight towards Bootstrap you won't understand how things work since Bootstrap was already pre-made for you. Once you learn the basics even you can create your own Bootstrap components. It would take time, but Hey, at least you know how it works and jobs/tasks would be much easier in the long run. That's the problem with most of the young modern developers, they rely mostly on pre-made or pre-coded Frameworks and Foundations, and when things go wrong, most of them won't be able to fix it. Good Luck man! Enjoy what you're doing and keep doing it. 
I agree with this.  I'm still a Jr dev, and my job requires a lot of work with Bootstrap, but having an understanding/experience in CSS is a huge boon.
Yes this is true. Get to grips with basic css before jumping into a framework. But I found that frameworks are key in understanding grid systems, forms and components which I was not fully aware of when I first started css. However, i retract what I said. As OP started learning last week, save the framework for when you're comfortable with CSS.
Bootstrap user here, could you tell me why you prefer foundation? Thinking about checking it out.
Foundation has fundamentally been lighter, but new Bootstrap is trying to solve some of those issues. Foundation seems to like things a bit spacier, and has less built in options for things (widgets, data tables, etc) but has plugins and extra modules for some that can be used. I dig foundation but used and played around with Bootstrap more. 
Cool, Im gonna check it out. Thanks
also any thoughts on how to give the text container some more depth? Maybe some sort of shadow? 
margin-top: -1em;
The problem is that background-color always displays behind other elements. You could either use a background-image for your header so it gets stacked or set a bogus transform on your overlapping div to create a new stacking context. It's weird I know. https://jsfiddle.net/6qv6gp48/
I think you could use the relative position, but just add the same amount of negative margin on the bottom:

http://codepen.io/anon/pen/gPxOGR
I'm surprised nobody has recommended this yet, but if you're only supporting newish browsers you can use 2D transformations, specifically translate-y
Made a quick mock for you:
https://jsfiddle.net/nq7rzm8a/1/

Make sure you use negative margin on the container with the white background.
Post code, not pic! :)

You can use `box-shadow:0 2px 4px #333`, or whatever values you want, to create a shadow.
yup that's exactly what I did and works like a charm. 
im basically doing 

    position: relative;
    top: -100px;
K... not seeing the empty gap: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/KVqLmW
Why not use absolute positioning?
Fine... hold on...
https://i.imgur.com/wzjctIi.png notice the gray.

Also your example has a gap at the bottom. it's not touching the footer. 
Because it wouldn't reserve the space the div is using?
You can negative `margin-bottom` at the same size as the negative top to counteract the offset you're doing.
Why will you not post code?

I see a gray background... is that the gray to which you are referring?

Oh... I just figured out what you're talking about... maybe. Here: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/yeXdvG
ding! we have a weiner. 
Some websites show a personal picture or phrase after you enter your username but before you enter your password to guard against phishing. If you were about to enter your password on a lookalike site it would be missing your phrase and picture.

I've seen this paired with a separate page for password before.
[deleted]
It is just a deterrent that makes it harder to automate password guessing (e.g. dictionary attacks).
Usually you can try a username and password combination with just one request, it takes only one roundtrip (request/response from the server) to get a result.

If you have to submit a username, wait for the response and then submit the password that's 2 roundtrips, i.e. double of the time.

Apart from that I don't know of any other benefit.
One use is that you enter your username, click next, and in the background your password salt will be returned to the front end. In the second phase when you enter your password, the hash is computed using this salt and no plain text password is sent through the requests. I might be at mistake, but afaik Google does something similar to this.
One goal of such pages is limiting the number of elements and scripts running on the login page to reduce the attack surface.  For example, if the login prompt is sitting on the same page as an ad from an ad network, are you absolutely certain that the ad cannot reach the data typed into those fields?  What about hosted javascript?  Sure, it's awful convenient to have the latest jquery pulled from the Google servers; but, it would be inconveniently awful if that central repository was compromised and included keylogging or the like.  By using a very tight and small login page, the attack surface can be controlled.  
Multiple accounts, federated logins, 2FA. Many reasons.
When Google made that change they said there wanted to explore  different authentication methods besides passwords. The two page approach enables you two show a different authentication method depending on the account.

[One thing they are testing](http://techcrunch.com/2015/12/22/google-begins-testing-password-free-logins/) is accepting a cell phone notification to login instead typing the password.
Another technical one is that if the first page is on HTTP there's no secure way you can submit a password in a form. The form has to go on an HTTPS page. For sites that don't use HTTPS everywhere that means having to put the password form on its own HTTPS page.
FYI, yes, some sites still do it, but it's no longer a valid method of protection. Most banks have moved away from it, or are in the process of doing so.

Here's a decent discussion on them: http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/19155/effectiveness-of-security-images
That's a horrible pattern. Usually I see it for websites that I rarely log in to, where I don't even remember the initial login setup. I wouldn't notice the picture or message being wrong. That pattern seems to pop up on important-but-poorly-designed sites, so go figure.
Came here to say this. I work at a university that uses Google Apps, but we have an authentication server on our campus that Google relies on for our users. So a typical flow for our users is:

- Go to Gmail
- Enter email address
- Get sent to our authentication server
- Submit username and password
- Our authentication server validates credentials
- User is returned, pre-authenticated, to Gmail

There's way more to it, technically, than that, but that's the gist. Before Google made the switch to email on one page and password on another, people were constantly entering both their username and their password twice. Now, they only enter their username twice (assuming they don't hit our auth server before they go to Google).
FYI separate User ID and credentials entering is best practice for any service that supports 2FA or any kind of delegated authority.

Because the credentials part could be a password, challenge/response or a number of other input mechanisms.
Also, from a front end experience, there's two other reasons (based on if you need to do it).

1. Autofilling forms is disabled if you're entering JUST a password with no text input before it.

2. Visually limiting the user input to focus a user. Some UI designers try to super limit a user focus to make it "simple"
My credit card company switched to two-stage authentication. 

I never really understood why, even if it does slow down brute attacks, they can mitigate this by just disabling the account after a few invalid logins anyway.

The problem as I see it, is that if you get to stage 2, you've already identified that the username is valid - which isn't the case when you ask for both on a single page

Maybe my credit card company was different, because they showed a 'personal graphic' on the password page (meaning they *had* to reveal the username was valid in order to prompt for the password)

They've since ditched it all though, and gone back to single page login.
I don't think this is true at all. If you were going to spam username+password requests it's hardly a problem to spam 1 username request followed by many password requests.

Password attempts are rate-limited of course so it's irrelevant which of the two systems they used.
For most of them the main reason is they have different login systems available for different users. Some users might authenticate using two factor authentication, some might use text message to log in. So you let them enter their email, so you can lookup if they even need a password field at all, and then present them with the appropriate next login step.
Why not just 2-step authenticate all the things?
I usually see it for financial websites. I would certainly notice if the wrong picture appeared, and having an additional protection in addition to 2FA to prevent giving the main password to an attacker is fine with me.
This is a very common practice for banks
How is that a horrible pattern? It's prevented me from locking an account I don't own in the past. See the wrong picture - oops! That's right, my usual username was taken when I signed up!
I don't see it as being a horrible pattern; for the common user it's probably much easier than looking for the EV greenbar or looking at the certificate details.  Probably a fair bit more reliable since they're likely to at least glace at the thing and *might* think about it a half second, as opposed to ignoring the certificate details completely.

There are only two websites I use that utilize this (both are financial), I suspect that if that number grew significantly the utility might be greatly diminished.
Why is that a horrible pattern. You can grab a BoA or Chase template site that looks one for one in minutes. This is a deterrant against those types of phishing attacks with a bait and switch password entry
Yes. Or there's the shitty way that, eg. buildkite uses where to do an OAuth login you enter your email, a blank password, and click "login" and then it redirects you for the OAuth flow. 

I much prefer to enter email, click next, then either enter my password or have the OAuth redirect. 
I don't know about other sites or password managers, but LastPass handle's Google's two screen login with ease.
> Autofilling forms is disabled if you're entering JUST a password with no text input before it.

This is not the case.
> The problem as I see it, is that if you get to stage 2, you've already identified that the username is valid 

Only if the system rejects requests with invalid usernames.  They probably shouldn't do that.
Financial websites are pretty much always the opposite of good UX, that's pretty much a rule they follow. My current bank has an on-screen keyboard you have to use to enter your password, it's a fucking pain (not to mention that their password requirement is literally "6 characters, at least 2 of which have to be numbers").

... While their mobile app only needs a PIN to use.
That's happened to me before
It makes it easier for a hacker to create a list of valid user names.
What stops a malicious site from internally doing a request to the real site to scrape the image?
If I were to build a phishing site I'd just make a request to the original site to get your picture. Not that hard to fake.
Yeah. Those handle them, but in browser auto fill (I know chrome's best) is keyed off a text field then password field. 

Some sites who want to prevent browsers from doing that (since autocomplete="off" hasn't worked in forever) do single input forms as their solution. (my bank for example)
As does KeePass with a FF extension. 
http://stackoverflow.com/a/22694173
Yes, this is true. But like I say my credit card company painted themselves into a corner by showing a personal graphic.

So by definition once you got to the password prompt, its already showing someones personal graphic, and therefore you know the username is a valid one.
Good ux pattern =/= quickest route to finishing in every situation.
Seems like you could get around that by supplying a random image when no account is found. I'm not advocating this as enhancing security, mind you, just as a further correlation that the user is logging into the account they think they want to.

Well, the registration form's "username taken" response is good enough for that.

For a sensitive website, user-generated usernames are a liability. Users reuse username/password combos wayyy too often across websites. For example, my banks make me log in with my account number.
Absolutely nothing, which is why it's a stupid practice.
You dont understand how the technology works and are making your lack of understanding painfully clear.

What do you think you would need to accomplish to get the picture I selected? Mind you this single picture provides you a unique visual that nobody can know unless they were capable of some form of session hijacking or unless they did...(fill in the blanks and we can see if you know what you are talking about)
Don't ever try to prevent my autofill from not working.

There are sites that do this, and I leave them to use another site if possible.
That's not true. Chrome fills the password-only form just fine.
You can solve this by including a dummy login inputs above the real ones and hide with CSS.
Maybe Chrome does that but I find it hard to believe they'd disable autofilling of your password on the Google sign in page. It works fine for me in Safari.
How can you tell if a graphic is someone's personal graphic?  They can pull from 1000000 clipart images if there's no user match.
This is so funny. Thanks for the laugh. 
I had a government contract a while back where I prevented them from autofilling in their social security number. There still are instances it is used properly, even if most times people use it they shouldn't.
I thought it would be quite hypocritical for Google to do that. I wouldn't even know what the sign in page looks like though, I don't think I've seen it since I got Gmail.
You're right, you couldn't tell from that alone

But on the few occasions at first when my browser auto-completed my old username, it would just shit out an error on the username step.
This literally contributed nothing.

Prove it wrong or don't respond. You could know absolutely nothing and respond with that....provide something that shows you are worth listening to.
Interesting. Out of curiosity, why did you care about it autofilling their SSN?
Banking websites with this feature are notoriously bad for their security practices. When you enter your email it is simply a form that returns the page with the unique image. With simple php I could request that page as if I submitted the form. I could parse the image out of the raw source code and display it in the phishing website. It seems like you think this is hard or impossible to do. But it is very straightforward. I use this method for all sorts of things. This is the reason you are being down voted, because you present your opinion in a condescending way along with it being incorrect. 
It was an app used in offices with shared computers, so they were concerned about privacy between employees who worked together.
[deleted]
Perhaps a banking site you might build would be that simple.  

Fortunately in today's world we have grown quite a bit.  Although the picture was proven to be ineffective wherein a case study in which they showed the user an error message in place of where the original was, all end users were tricked and they found this image to be a pointless addition [source](http://www.ece.cmu.edu/~lbauer/papers/2014/w2sp2014-securityimages.pdf), no you cannot just request it when leveraging the appropriate security.  I imagine you are assuming you are going directly over http as well as a slew of other assumptions as well, correct?  Perhaps the user logged in to their computer, got up to go to the bathroom, and gave you an hour?  How about we be realistic.

I'm starting to wonder if you've ever seen it implemented, then again, I truly don't care.  I'll wait for a few more years until you've graduated to give your expert opinion on what banking sites are so great at.  Must be all those years of industry work you have under your belt...
That doesn't seem like the responsibility of the site. That's poor security on the devices themselves.
Right, but this isn't a function of the website. It's the browser. Someone savvy enough could still get the information (easily) if they have access to the machine.
Citibank, the last largest and most powerful bank in the world, literally had a case where you could [change the query string](http://m.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/2079431/citibank-hacked-altering-urls) to access other user's credit card numbers. You over estimate their security techniques. This was in 2011 mind you. They rely on the fact that they and insured and can cover a loss. Please don't throw personal insults at me. I'm simply saying that you're thinking that banks are better then they are. 
If you've ever worked on government dollars for websites, you learn quickly that telling them to fix what they're doing is a losing battle. 
Exactly, browsers like Chrome even store this in plain text, accessible to anyone who takes a peek in your settings.
2011....lol...ok whatever.  This thread is dead.  Look at all the major attacks from 2011 (CIA, Lockheed Martin, Gmail, CitiBank [source](http://www.businessinsider.com/imf-cyber-attacked-hackers-sony-rsa-lockheed-martin-epsilon-michaels-2011-6?op=1) ) But go on with your bad self.

You don't work for a bank, you haven't worked in the industry, and I promise if you think developers who create these types of vulnerabilities just say "Well we've got insurance so no worries"  and don't fear losing their jobs, you are sadly mistaken.  The attack you are talking about is a session hijacking attack using arbitrary sessionids in a bruteforce  loop and scraping any id that exists with an active session.  Session Hijacking, which I mentioned earlier....your point?  It isn't something new and was something that a lot of people did back then and still today.  There has  been a serious overhaul where if you are dealing with this type of attack, you have bigger problems on your development and security team.  This affected many many people.

> They rely on the fact that they and insured and can cover a loss.

**Regardless Citi ordered new cards for 100k customers absorbing the $2 million loss it cost them to do it.**[source](http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304778304576375911873193624) 
*Wrong Again*


At any point in time there are vulnerabilities that come to light which are massively exploited.  Banks, large organizations, many large groups worth going after are likely to have slower adoption due to the cost of upgrades, and the leviathan like state of their development.  Banks become obvious because their is an immediate incentive if you can get in.  It doesn't mean they are the worst of the worst, if anything, they are larger targets and are constantly balancing the exposure vs the cost of implementing new measures.  

Studies have been done showing how installing bullet proof glass would protect bankers from being robbed at gunpoint and potentially save lives.  Due to the fact being robbed cost less than installing the glass, they opted against it in a cost savings decision.  There is so much more that you don't consider when making bold statements like that.[Source](http://zacharykulpinski.blogspot.com/2013/03/why-dont-all-banks-have-bulletproof.html)

It's not an insult, you are talking as if you have experience from this area, and you don't.  Even in the worst of jobs working towards the industry, heck even a startup, you will deal with real world scenarios that cannot be emulated in a classroom environment.

I bring in Interns ever year and they have this same mentality, when they walk out at the end it is a humbling experience for many of them.  You insulted me saying I didn't understand when it turns out, you've never been exposed to any of these scenarios and have to dig up cases from half a decade ago....you look foolish.
Wow. Thanks for writing so much! I really didn't mean any offense. I have no idea why you assume that I've never worked but I have. I've worked for three startups and have built countless login systems. I'm just saying that when yahoo had this feature it was very simple for me to build my attack. It was also easy to do it on Bank of America. I've talked to many in the banking industries (at family gatherings or whatever) and they have also attested that superiors often demand features despite developers protests. It sounds like you work in the industry so I apologize if the industry has since cleaned up there act (or I was talking to biased people). 
lol...Yeah, you can always tell when you strike a nerve with a young kid....all the lies come in a single paragraph.  

Not offended, this is reddit.  You'll either become a better liar or just learn to be more honest....I guess it all depends on the type of person you are.
The easiest way would probably using WordPress or something like Wix.com or Squarespace.com
Step 0: Before you do anything else, do some discovery on the framework/platform/stack/whateverelsepeoplewanttocallittoday. Understand what you have to work with first. Is the current site just HTML pages being served from a Windows server? A Linux server?

Step 1: Make a sitemap. Lots of people probably skip this step but it's a good idea to help you understand how all your content is related on a larger scale. 

Step 2: Choose a CMS (Content Management System), as has been suggested, like Wordpress, Drupal, Joomla, dotCMS, Kentico, etc. Each CMS framework will have ample documentation on how to best go about setting up templates for your pages and how to organize your content. Consider how much content you have and how each piece of content is related to the rest. This may impact your choice of CMS.

Step 3: Design your new page layouts keeping in mind the limitations that your chosen CMS may have on how it generates template pages.

Step 4: Implement your designs in your chosen CMS and tell us about it so we can praise/mock you for all your hard work.

Good luck! :)
what is your current website?

do a site architecture/main nav.  Know what pages you need and where they go. Good content is key. 

you can pick up tutorials on web dev at [codeacademy.com](http://www.codeacademy.com) and use a responsive framework like [bootstrap](http://www.getbootstrap.com) if you want to dive into some of the code yourself.  Otherwise Ryan_77 is right, you should start with wordpress or something.  Do you know what stack/host your current site uses?  example, apache server or windows server.


Wordpress man, you can have options of useful and relevant templates for you to implement on upgrading the site. I might be able to help you on doing it. I enjoy mostly doing CMS sites with the basic blog content updates, maybe this site can help you otherwise. 
http://makeawebsitehub.com/
Yeah, I'd probably start off with a CMS, like u/Ryan_77 suggested, and if you're interested in spinning your own site look into Ruby on Rails, the MEAN stack, or Django.
I'm working as senior developer in top5 world magento company. We obviously have world wide known clients. There is talks in our company that there's couple of great alternatives for Magento that could be a solid opponent. Also we are considering to start working on our own solution. That said unless you are huge company that focus on e-com doing it from scratch is not worth it. If you are interested I'll provide list of possible choices with short description that you can show to your team lead/project manager.
I'd recommend Prestashop, more free and useful plugins than Magento(I've used Magento before), but if you have a team than can create it from scratch then better. Open-source can screw up the development with all the plugins involved, If one plugin cannot keep up with the current version of the Open-source software then It would cause problems in the long run in my experience. 
Thank you for the good question. I have some thoughts regarding this. Open-source platforms are good for small projects with low level of demands and limited budget. 

Besides, you may be urged to pay for 3rd party software which will be offered for you to improve your initially free website. Those who have more complicated business or are aimed at the long-term growth stand for such platforms like this (https://www.retailecart.com). 

It costs some money, however trial is absolutely free of charge. It is integration-friendly and your team will not spend much time to get used to admin panel and user area. Check it if you prefer â€œall-in-oneâ€ development, starting from layout and finishing with warehouse management.
I'm also interested in this.  We work a lot with Magento but are currently looking for alternatives that are not in PHP. Hopefully your list will provide some examples of systems that we haven't found yet.
Yes please... can you write the details in these thread/post sir, for future reference . I'll just link this post to him .Thank you sir.


Updated my post, brief overview, sorry, but there's not much non-php solutions :/
Okay I'll edit that post when I'll be at home

EDIT1: Oh damn, I've completely forgot about that, sorry.

EDIT2: Here we go (keep in mind that is mostly taken from our confluence and may be slightly outdated):

1. Magento: Advanced knowledge required (PHTML/XML - must) difficult to work without knowledge of Magento Developer Guidelines, advanced file and code structure. Open source, PHP, Zend Framework, standalone.

2. ZenCart: Averenge PHP knowledge required. Oldish, not user-friendly. Open-source, PHP, no framework, standalone.

3. VirtueMart: Nothing special, many required functionalities are missing, use only if client already running Joomla. Open-source, PHP, no framework, used with Joomla, mambo.

4. osCommerce: Many developers left to ZenCart and Magento and hacked in 2011. Losing positions and any potential. Open-source, PHP, no framework, standalone.

5. PrestaShop: Almost all Magento Community and some Magento Enterprise features for free - Magento competitor. Export to eBay, RMA, Loyalty Program, refferal rewards. Open-source, PHP, Smarty, standalone.

6. Volusion: Use custom Volusion API and provide dev wiki, code examples looks really complicated. Impressive functionality provided. Top rated e-com platform. Not open-source, PHP, no framework, used with Drupal.

7. Ubercart: Includes standard package of e-com features, nothing special. Open-source, PHP, no framework, used with Dropal.

8. BIGCommerce: Uses REST API. Impressive functionality provided, however only templating is possible, no access to login functions or php files. Not open-source, no framework, standalone

9. OpenCart: Only base e-com features available, fast growing platform that have a potential. Open-source, PHP, no framework, standalone.

10. WPCommerce: Very simple PCI, very easy to customize. Use only if running Wordpress or need fast solution for simple store with several categories and 20-50 products. Wordpress is most popular blogging platform and unbelievably user-friendly, probably best solution for very small stores. Open-source, PHP, no framework, used with Wordpress.

11. CS Cart: Top class e-com solution using multi-vendor edition, probably top Magento competitor. Open-source (free only community edition), PHP, Zend Framework, standalone. Excellent UI (Better than Magento/Shopify)

12. Shopify: Very impressive platform, modern and stylish, rapidly growing, have a potential. Not open-source, PHP, no framework, standalone.

13. Mive Merchant: Uses custom API, interesting platform to look at. Standard package of e-com features. Not open-source, MIVA Script, no framework, standalone.

14. IBM Commerce: Not open-source, Java EE, standalone. Standard package of e-com features. Can't give more details due no experience in Java.

Because people have been posting about it here since it was first announced, and for most people, it doesn't have any actual, immediate effect because all they're concerned with are what browsers are currently visiting their sites.

Just because Microsoft no longer supports IE 8, 9 and 10, doesn't mean they're going to suddenly blink out of existence. Like IE 4, 5, 6 and 7 (and Netscape 4, and many other browsers) before them, there will be a number of people who will continue to use them for a variety of reasons.
>Just because Microsoft no longer supports IE 8, 9 and 10, doesn't mean they're going to suddenly blink out of existence.

Exactly and big companies still need to make the change. 
I'm still using grunt + npm, can't say I'm lacking something. As long as the current solution fits your needs, I don't think there's a reason to chase the latest trend(s).
I feel like Gulp won that war a long time ago. Nowadays it is all about webpack etc.
So... There's a "final choice" on a list of options after having only tried two of the three options....

Edit:

Actually, that "final choice" may have been made after using *one* of the options, giving up on it, and then "googling" the other two.
I never asked you to chase the latest trends, it does boil down to the choice of configuration vs code in the end anyway
There is Browserify, webpack, and then there is jspm. The list is pretty long and I am sure it will keep increasing with time
I did not just google gulp vs grunt and make a choice, and what good is the amount of information available out there if you do not research about it before getting a hands on experience?
Sorry if this came out as an attack on your text, it was not meant to be. I just wrote it as a sort of "response" to the mention of webpack in another comment.
You had a decent section describing your experience with npm, immediately followed by a section headed "The final choice," which began:

> Then googling kicked in and though most people have their own preferences when choosing one among gulp and grunt, I chose gulp for the following reasons

The short list of bullet points doesn't really make it sound like you made a decision after adequately testing both options.

There is nothing wrong with this approach.  I think it's better to just start using something (after some cursory research to verify its at least in the right ballpark for what you want).

I just don't think this article provides any meaningful contributions in assisting anyone else who might be on the fence about which to use beyond "npm has issues on Windows, so that can be avoided."  More in-depth reporting on your personal experiences (similar to what you did for npm) may have been helpful.
It's alright. There always will be something new to explore. That is what makes the tech space interesting
There was nothing much to add to the differences in between gulp and grunt except for the short list of bullets. And the choice among these too is a personal preference usually, as I wrote in the paragraph that followed the bullelts. But I will try and make that list a bit more longer. If you have any points, I will add them as well

WHOA, that is absolutely AWESOME!

:) 

Love the ascii.
I just installed New Relic - and I was surprised how much was available from the free tier. This is what's included:

* **Server monitoring.** Memory, HD, CPU, I/O and Network are all graphed - just need to set up some simple alerts to make sure none of those peak. I did this to all five of my servers. This helped me tune my memory on each server as I was only using about 10% of my total.
* **Website "Pings".** New Relic will allow you to set up all your websites to be monitored from different locations from around the globe. I have monitoring from Portland, Washington DC and Dublin, Ireland. They expose metrics such as: DNS Query, Server Connect, SSL Connect, Server Send, Wait and Time to First Byte. All very useful for pinpointing out any problem areas. 

All in all - I'm very happy with everything so far. It's been valuable to expose a side of the web that I'm not normally in. 
Agreed, its very very feature rich. Takes awhile to learn what all the graphs and charts are showing. In ruby they also show you a list of your slowest route, slowest calls with a breakdown of time spend in different categories (SQL, app calls, network, etc). That has been incredibly useful to track down perf.

It could also potentially help you figure out which of 2 approaches is faster. With the ruby gem, you get a /newrelic route that loads a local basic reporting of the request with a sort of waterfall of SQL and timings. Or you could turn on some kind of SQL logging to see how long each request takes. Sometimes its obvious, one approach makes 300 nested sql calls, the other just 1.
I understand 'inlining' seems bad. But the inlining that is bad, is things like <span style=" .. styling .."></span>. This inlining can be good, if executed the right way.

It's smart to place the most important CSS within the <head>. This makes sure the page is visible after the first response from the server arrived. Then, afterwards, another request is send to get the CSS file and the rest of the styling loads.   
A lot of major companies do it this way, and it's an easy way to speed up the loading of a webpage.

However, I do miss this in Bootstrap and other front-end tools. I really would like a tool which selects the most important (above the fold) CSS and puts it in the head for me. Otherwise it would cost me too much time to do this optimalization. Does somebody know a tool for this?
A nightmare for maintainability unless you use something like [Addy Osmani's Critical](https://github.com/addyosmani/critical). 

Nice idea though in theory, and I'd be interested in using it if I could implement  something automated into my workflow.
Depending on how they propose we implement this, it could be an accessibility issue. Many users have custom stylesheets that they use to do things like make text bigger and improve contrast and inline styles may override that in some cases. Not pretty. 
This something you should only do if you are really looking to optimize your page loads. For almost all practical purposes you should simply use an external style sheet.
This is a good way to avoid page repaint, which I would argue affects page performance than HTTP request latency (which is easily optimized).

When I saw the title at first I thought "Well Google always *do it wrong* for live."


I feel browsers should do this analysis themselves and cache "plans" for rendering pages similar to how SQL engines cache plans for accessing database data. 

I also never understood why they cache the plain text of the resource and then re-parse them every time. Why not cache a binary representation of the CSS/JS/HTML that is already parsed and ready to slam into memory?

Invalidate these "render" plans when the content files change. This may add a little bit of time to "first-time-ever" render, but if it can detect "hey these 5 rules are used immediately, while the rest are not used, let me mark and cache these critical rules."

Seems like so much can be done in this area... though WASM is a good step in delivering this content in a binary format right from the start, so perhaps WASM compilers can encode this kind of optimization during compile time.
But it feels so wrong :(
Yep, this is for performance. CSS is render blocking, meaning the browser must stop and pull in CSS bytes before continuing to render the page. If you're loading CSS from a URL, that means your browser needs to wait for the bytes to download across the open internet before it can start rendering, then the browser renders, and only then can it continue to render the rest of the document. The open internet is a big bottleneck, so if you're just pulling in a small CSS file, it can make more sense to inline it and get rid of that bottleneck.
If you have control of your web server and you're using SSL its a good idea to use the Pagespeed module and use the 'Inline CSS' filter to do this automatically.

    #Apache:
    ModPagespeedEnableFilters inline_css

    #Nginx:
    pagespeed EnableFilters inline_css;
    in the configuration file.
    
When this filter is enabled, you may also enable the following setting:
    
    #Apache:
    ModPagespeedCssInlineMaxBytes bytes

    #Nginx:
    pagespeed CssInlineMaxBytes bytes;


Also, while you are at it look at other filters such as using WebP
There are plugins for most taskrunners for critical path rendering: http://fourkitchens.com/blog/article/use-gulp-automate-your-critical-path-css
tl;dr: Inlining is good for performance. Not inlining is good for maintainability of code.
I still maintain that bootstrap is only good when there's no design.  E.g. rapid deployment. If you have a designer doing designs for you, then bootstrap just gets in the way.
From the article: 

Don't inline CSS attributes
-------
Inlining CSS attributes on HTML elements (e.g.,Â <p style=...>) should be avoided where possible, as this often leads to unnecessary code duplication. Further, inline CSS on HTML elements is blocked by default withÂ Content Security PolicyÂ (CSP).
-------

Personally, I think that using <style> tags is fine for inline styles, but style attributes are a pain to work with and maintain. Plus, it screws up your specificity. 
[deleted]
well you linked to a gulp plugin that could automate it in your build process. If you aren't using gulp here is a list of resources with node modules, grunt and gulp modules, server side modules, browser based tools, bookmarklets and a host of other information on it. 

* [Critical Path CSS Tools](https://github.com/addyosmani/critical-path-css-tools)  

Hopefully http2's push module comes to all ~~browsers~~ servers soon and we can skip this! 
DOM is a lot bigger than the html representation.

And actually, Firefox already does this.  Mutate your dom in firefox. Then follow a link.  Hit back.  You'll get the same dom.
Very interesting. I use Webpack for which I found that [UnCSS] is still a [feature request][#216], but [it seems][#155231759] there's a [plugin] for [PurifyCSS] which does the same job. Thanks for the share!

Well, with build tools it actually becomes easy for maintainence.
Exactly. Except that the disadvantage can be taken away by using the right tool.
I agree, if I use bootstrap im literally just copy pasting from the bootstrap docs. I never try to build on top of bootstrap
Yes. As a said, (maybe not clear enough) style attributes shouldn't be used. Style tags are okay.
I always refer to style tags as embedding, and style attributes as inlining, which made me confused about the title.
Why would you use a CDN for Bootstrap? That would mean that you have one file for Bootstrap and another one for your custom CSS. You should just use LESS and make one minified CSS file which contains Bootstrap and your custom code.

I do understand why inlining is important. The page loads, and the most important CSS is there. On slow high latency networks, this makes the page show 0.5-1s quicker, which is huge.   
However, it must be easy to put the most important CSS there, and there needs to be a good tool for this. Because doing it by hand would be crazy.
> well you linked to a gulp plugin that could automate it in your build process

Yeah I'm aware of that. Getting it working nicely for large commercial projects is a different story, though.
You can easily import text from the file path instead of linking to it.
It would be nice if that were a generally practiced nuanced terminology, but the tag is still inline because it's not in a separate file. 
[deleted]
ha sorry about that... I didn't even take into account large, already in progress & built projects. That is kind of a pain... If you could and its feasible you might wanna look toward the pagespeed server modules. I've used those in the past and they will do it for you. Specifically [prioritize critical-css](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/module/filter-prioritize-critical-css)  

Downside is it takes I think two visits before its inlined. You also have to option to optimize your images, minify JS/CSS. Those filters can be found [here](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/module/filters) 
Embedded would still technically be online, and embedded still conveys there not being a separate file. It works for JS and SVG as well.
You have to load one CSS file for your custom CSS anyway. Why make things complicated and load one CSS file for your custom code, and another one with the Bootstrap CDN, and then make a fallback for when the CDN goes down? That's more work for no gain (because one file gets loaded anyway).
I don't believe your numbers.  I would be interested to see a real study on cache hits for CDN-hosted bootstrap or jquery.
Yeah I definitely think it's worth the investment in research/time though - thanks for the links.
[deleted]
I understand it's about optimisation. I know how to make websites / web applications fast. That's one of my obsessions.

A CDN however, doesn't add to that. It doesn't give you things that you can't do yourself. For CSS, you shouldn't include the full Bootstrap file. That's just a waste. You don't use 70% of that. Don't include that. Just include the 30% that you do use by using LESS and put it in one file together with your custom CSS.

For Javascript, you should never even think about using a CDN. Those are blocking requests. You always have a combination of framework (jquery, bootstrap), modules and custom code. That should all be in one file just before the </body> tag.

About CDN failure. Of course, the chance that a CDN fails is very very low. [But luckily, we always have other companies do stupid stuff.](http://www.ispreview.co.uk/index.php/2014/01/uk-isp-sky-broadband-shield-accusing-blocking-critical-jquery-website.html). Also, this small filter change, caused a huge failure on tons of websites for a lot of people. A lot of people didn't have it cached, and those people receive a slower experience when they load your website. But most important: You can't trust an external resource on your page. You can include it, but always provide a fallback.

http://www.sprymedia.co.uk/article/Visual+Event+2

Not exactly same thing but it's quite handy.
What does this do different than chromed break on... Features? I can usually just trace down the call stack to the origin of the event handler.
Visual Event is pretty nice. 
My experience with it in pages that have many events is that it can be a bit slow, but the last time I used it was more than a year ago.
If you are not familiar with the code base this allows you to find the code that handles a particular event quickly. 
To use the breakpoint feature you need to know where to put the breakpoint first.
I wished more cinemas used this.
Codrops never ceases to amaze me. 
Also, it's impressive to see how many developers - go to Themeforest for example - are using their code (nothing wrong with it, I once contacted them when I was building a WP theme and they were totally fine with it)
Yeah this is pretty cool. Should probably sell this to AMC and make some money
That is awesome! I would love to book tickets using that thing.
Hi /r/webdev, I hope this doesn't class as spam

A few of the team at an agency I work for have created a football game where we use Google Maps to plot out the transfers of footballers to creative an interactive game and wanted to share with as many people as possible.

We hope you like it, if there's anything you want to know please ask away.
Would it be possible to include a mode with no time limit and the ability to cycle through all available players?

Other than that, I'm really enjoying it so far.
Lovely idea, a few people have already suggested it so we'll look into it!
digitalocean
Here's who I wouldn't recommend - GoDaddy
Depends, do you need a managed service (ie. the company sets up the servers, security etc) or you want to manage the servers yourself?

For a managed service, I can recommend SiteGround, otherwise go for DigitalOcean as others have already suggested.
Digital Ocean or AWS.
Vultr. Have had an excellent experience with them for the last ~6 months
My own company ;)
Hostgator or NameCheap for smaller sites or shared hostings. 
If you host your assets on a CDN, distance doesn't matter much in terms of the user experience. 
Seconding this. Used them for multiple projects now without any issues. And they offer servers hosted in the US.
Yes, I wouldn't recommend it either. I have a client Wordpress site on it and it keeps crashing and then we transferred to another hosting and It's all good with the same files and all, Plus the navigation sucks, Their support sucks as well. 
I couldn't even upload a database with their server timing out.
Which is? :)
nah, we're not on a cdn, just regular shared hosting, the sites are small and basic html/css
Relentless Hosting, we're Australian based though so might not be right for you.
Ah yeh, boss wants US, sorry mate :)
All good, if you're ever after australian hosting feel free to message me.
Are your servers guarded by venomous kangaroos that throw box jellyfish at trespassers? :)
Of course ;)
Great Write-up!
looks like a good project ... you can easily do this using joomla. I think joomla is built for this kind of use cases
Im not sure what to put on a resume like that. I always stay a bit personal. 

But whatever you do, don't come up with self-invented ways to 'rate' yourself. 5/7 Javascript will not mean anything, because there isn't a standard rate for knowledge.
And you;re always learning. 

Good luck
An async Fizz Buzz solution in ES7.
When it comes to experience, make sure to list achievements over responsibilities. The interviewing manager will be using your resume as a talking point, so specific examples they can drill in to always trump basic responsibilities. 

**Bad Example**
Coded in HTML, CSS, Javascript and ran daily builds. Committed code to GitHub, ensured everything was up to date.

**Good Example**
Implemented Gulp build process (concat, lint, minify) for <project> resulting in a large reduction of file size and errors. 
Everyone's got their own ideas of what should be in a resume but I'll throw my own quarter byte in here.

I would personally avoid objective, it's a bit clichÃ© these days.  Unless you have something very specific in mind, your objective is to get the job.  The employer knows this because you applied for it.

I would try to ask your previous employers/clients if you're allowed to include examples of projects where you were the primary developer.  Try to cherry pick the most attractive ones.

Also, if possible regurgitate the job requirements back to them in your skills section, and if possible research the company and include some skills that are relevant to their sector (E.g. if they do websites for primarily public sector clients, include any experience you have with development in that area.)
Code.

Why do you need a tool for transparency? Effective communication and clear planning already takes care of this. Having clients with direct access to a dev/design team ultimately reduces productivity.

have you thought about asp.net mvc?
If you are comfortable with Laravel, i'd say that's your best best.  It's a lot better now, and we use it at work.  It's a fintech company that produces lots and lots of real time charts, tables, and information with php/javascript/jquery and speed has never been an issue.  Using something you already know (but have improved knowledge on) will enable you to prototype faster, and plan it out better.  
laravel is still very good, why not just update to laravel 5.2 and PHP 7? And maybe some vue.js on the frontend
Not a bad idea, is 5.2 easy to adapt to after 4? 
What he described is my current stack. 

I tried Laravel during 4 but didn't like it, came back with 5 and can say 5.2 is an improvement. Its a seamless adaption.
Drag & drop is shit, Wix is shit. Either set up a standard, blank template to use as a base for your sites, or optimize your workflow. Tab completion, Emmet, automatic snippets, etc.. all allow you to write complete HTML pages in minutes. It's 2016, there is literally 0 need for drag&drop if you take yourself serious as a developer.
Macaw? Edge?
The default margin on the h1 is causing the gap. Set the h1 to have zero margins, or better yet use a good CSS reset. 
Try adding margin and padding 0 to html.  
If that doesn't work, try to load a clear fix before your new css.
what is a CSS reset?
Is there a way to get rid of the default margins on header and p tags?
Unfortunately that did not work, but I'll give the clear-fix a try.
The clearfix worked! Thank you!
A CSS reset placed before your own CSS will set sane default styles on all elements, maintaining consistency between browsers and also may remove unwanted margins and padding from elements such as h1 or p.

Here is what is probably considered the gold standard of CSS resets, but there are many: http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/
    h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, p {
      margin: 0;
    }
Thanks a bunch! 
According to http://searchengineland.com/tested-googlebot-crawls-javascript-heres-learned-220157 google does index angular apps without backend

but if Facebook crawling requires a back-end wouldn't it make more sense to do one solution to solve both? I'll definitely explore this solution though, thanks a bunch
haha thanks i fixed it :P
No not for different clients ... Just upgrade your hosting to a reseller plan and use a WHM to assign everyone their own cpanel. 
thanks guys
If you host your clients, be prepared for 1am calls complaining that their email is down when they just forgot their password. 

In my opinion, don't host for clients unless you have a support team. It just isn't worth always being at their beck and call. 
Compare WP with hosting offered by Shopping Cart Elite (https://www.ecartsforesolution.com). Is it secure enough? I am very much concerned regarding data security and this was my core issue which made me stay with SCE. 

They guarantee data recovery and have their own servers. Also, there is Hypersonic CDN technology. It makes your website load up to 7 times faster and this affects customer satisfaction during the shopping process. 

You can text support agents and they will tell you more about hosting opportunities. Regarding the price, I can say it is attractive because paying once a month you get bundle of unlimited eCommerce tools. 
IMAP is free and comes with most all hosting plans. Google Apps for business is $5 per email address but bulletproof. 
I have been using Zoho's mail for a while now. If you have a single domain you can create up to 10 mailboxes for free (and you can then also do forwarders, such as support@yourdomain.com that forwards off to each of you, which doesn't count as a mailbox)

If you need beyond that, the other service I use for another client that has multiple domains on their account is Rackspaces's hosted mail, i think it is $2/month/mailbox
For receiving use Google Apps for Business. It's worth it.

For sending from your app/servers you should use something like Mandrill or MailGun. It's worth it.

You can do these things yourselves with postfix, DKIM/SPF and a few other bits but if you're serious about email it's just not worth it to roll your own nowadays.

You want your users to get your emails and you want to make sure you're getting theirs.
This is most likely what I'll do, thanks a ton :)
I second this.  Been using them for ages with no problems.  Set up is also really easy.
We're pretty frugal at the moment, at this stage the project is considered as an educational project. In a couple months time we plan on transitioning to a start up and hopefully look for an accelerator program. I'll look into Google Apps for Business but with the costs of hosting, domain names, and technologies I might have to hold off on the it for now haha.
HTML/PHP solution or a CMS?
The easiest way is to build a web page that allows file uploads. This will require that you have a server somewhere to hold the uploaded files. When you are done with the files, email the files back. I just did exactly this for a client whose users were not technical.

A log-in page is trivial, less so if you need a password reset feature. You need a server and a database to take in and store user information. Securing web pages and data is much too comprehensive of a topic for a Reddit post. You will need to do your own research.

How do you manage severa, websites each with their own cpanel? Do you have to pay month,y for a vps?
The emails are through a shared hosting reseller account. How the email is hosted is out of my control, but I'd love to be able to check the email addresses I must monitor with imap but through another cloud hosted service. Gmail does this but checks the imap addresses very infrequently (30min +) which is unworkable for my needs.
[deleted]
I used this method for a while but found certain emails were not being forwarded. My best guess is that Google was filtering them for some reason but they weren't ending up in spam or trash or anywhere. Couldn't figure it out but was a huge problem. This approach also leaves all emails on the server which means the server space fills up quickly.
Dude you can quit a job whenever you want, contract or no.
I mean I took a law class and by no means am an expert, but I know that some contracts (think magazine subscriptions) auto-renew legally when they interpret silence as intent to continue. I'd ask a lawyer or even talk to HR.
If the contract doesn't automatically renew, and you didn't renew it, why do you think it has been renewed?
My contracts are extended through signing a new statement of services with dates, pricing, etc.

I'm sure you're not bound to that at all if you didn't sign anything. Just give your 2 weeks and be done.
Check your contract, there should be a section on renewal, but you might have to sign a new one. I've worked before in a couple of places where its a "sign of good will" to continue working whilst I wait for the company to get it together to sign a new one, although this means you can run the risk of not being paid. Ultimately it's up to you to make sure you know when your contract ends so you can renegotiate your terms if you want to.
Look on the bright side, that means they really like you! lol. 
What in God's name are you talking about? A job? Quit the job if you don't like it...
I enjoyed the job, but I had a contracting job that did this to me for about 3 years of contracting. 
i was just told by a dude from the contracting company minutes ago.. It was getting close to the 6mo date and i still had heard nothing so i reached out to the contracting company... they responded with "Martha extended you last month for another 6 months."  I'm just thinking... Umm... When did i agree to that?
Oh for sure. This is what my plan is. I'm not going to pitch a fit or anything. Im putting in my 2 weeks tomorrow. I just wanted to get some perspective from yall.
Really depends on what your specific contract says. There might be a clause that lets them extend it.
If you haven't communicated a desire for a new contract and you're doing acceptable work, my experience is that managers and contracting companies will extend your contract whenever it is about to be up. Since you didn't tell anyone (from what I gather), they went ahead and renewed. 
This is a big no,no. They can't just auto-renew a contract on you like that. I would default on it and move onto your next thing.
If you are designing a site in HTML with something like Dreamweaver you can't just add on CKeditor to it and have editable content. You need a database and content management system for that.

If you want editable content by far the easiest way to do so for a beginner is to build a site with something that is a CMS with editable content out of the box, like Wordpress.
Wordpress
>Edit: Oops I guess I shouldn't criticize WordPress on here.

You are in for a very bad time with an attitude like this. You come here with a question that shows zero understanding of dynamic web development but somehow are an expert about the capabilities of CMS systems? Lose your know-it-all attitude and listen to what people are telling you. This is the best advice you will get all week. I say this as someone who hasn't built a site with Wordpress in over five years.
Thank you, I've started looking at CMS's like joomla and sitecake. I think these might solve my problem (wordpress ~~is a bit too underpowered for what I need to do~~ does not have everything I want).
This. 
I apologize, I misspoke when I originally said Wordpress is underpowered. I meant more that it doesn't have everything I need. I added that comment you quoted to try to make a joke but it seems like it was in bad taste. I am very grateful for your help however, and would like you to know that. :)
not sure why you say WordPress is "underpowered" but if that's really the case, check out Drupal.
Sitecake doesn't use a database, it just allows CMS-like editing of content - if you think Wordpress is underpowered in comparison you are fundamentally mistaken. It might well be suitable for your needs though if editing content is the only dynamic feature you want, and looks like it would be very easy to set up and use for a beginner that is used to working directly with HTML files.

I wouldn't recommend Joomla because of its paid extensions. Drupal would be my choice for something more serious than Wordpress as its extensions/modules are all free, if you have a choice of which to use. But both have a steep learning curve for a beginner compared to Wordpress and someone who doesn't know what they're doing can easily end up spending many, many hours and end up with a website that's a real mess. I would recommend sticking to something simpler to begin with like Wordpress or Sitecake to avoid frustration.
What doesn't Wordpress have that you need?
With sitecake I can just implement it into the website I've already made with html and such. It doesn't appear I can do it that simply with wordpress.
Yeah that's correct, development for CMS systems is far more complicated as you have to turn your page designs into themes/templates. It's not that hard once you know how but there is a very steep learning curve and it's a different process with each CMS. Sitecake works very much like the templating system in Dreamweaver you may already be used to. If all you need is editable content it's probably a good choice.
You can find the fonts in a PDF as well, open in Acrobat -> File -> Properties -> Fonts

As a Developer working with PSD to HTML/HTML5 templates, this makes work a lot easier. Thanks man. 
Just upload it to Adobe Assets and it'll do much more too. 
Much needed. Thanks.
Somewhat related: what's a good font manager for Windows you are using? Must be able to browse uninstalled fonts. 
Is there anything like this for Illustrator or maybe InDesign? Maybe even for PDF's?
I made the same script, but it's full Node.JS and doesn't require Photoshop at all. It reads the PSD and outputs in the console a list of all the fonts used and their size. It's pretty much working but it needs some polishing.
Curious what webdevs are using Photoshop for? Just cutting up someone's PSD or something more?
Recently switched from Photoshop CC to Sketch. Now I'm kicking myself for not doing it soon enough. Just a month ago I purchased GuideGuide plugin. Man, what a waste of money. 
thanks!
Do you need an active Creative Cloud subscription for that?
I use [nexusfont](http://www.xiles.net/). It's lightweight and very fast, and has all the (basic) functions I need without too much bloat.
Type > Find Font...
As @halomac said, thankfully no. I found it when I gave up trying to use wine and gimp to load Photoshop to read PSD's our designer was sending over. This gives you the CSS for certain items, allows you to select layers and download them and also see font information.

Extremely useful :)
No.
Thanks I'll certainly give it a spin  
You may want to warn them in advance: This will never work on iPads or most mobile devices.
They're pretty much like images, you use a standard boilerplate set of HTML markup and mention the path as the source. 
Use SWFObject. Even Adobe does.
Those 5-6 year old articles are the most up to date :)
Wow, I haven't even heard of a SWF file in years lol. Can they be converted to another format?
Do I need to upload all of the files they gave me or is the one swf file enough? I really have no idea what I'm doing with these files.
Using SWFObject and this is what ends up happening:
https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/40pf0e/code_works_locally_but_not_on_the_server/


Any help is greatly appreciated. 
Yeah I tried converting the using an online converter and that didn't go too well. Any suggestions about what format to convert to? 
I'll give it a look first thing tomorrow. Do you have a link or example beyond screenshots? Something semi-public so I can poke it and look for errors?
sorry, but I don't have any other suggestions. I haven't worked with SWF in years.
Remote pair programming is quite standard. 
Sometimes you don't share your whole screen but you use a shared google document or something like http://collabedit.com/

At least that's my experience for senior software engineer interviews
I've had to do this with pretty much every company I've interviewed with.
I've rejected any interview with an exam portion.  Your prior experience, portfolio and qualifications should be enough for a company to decide along with a face to face interview.

If I were hiring a builder to build an extension I wouldn't ask him to throw together a patio so I can assess his work. So why should it be any different for developers.
I see. Is it mostly fundamentals to make sure that you're for real? I've never interviewed at this level so I really have no idea what to expect. My last interviews were for more jr level positions and then I worked my way up.
Really? Do you mind saying what level of job you were going for? What was your take on it?
I don't think that building an app is normally the intention, it's to ensure candidates understand basic fundamentals and concepts.  I understand, a builder isn't going to build a patio - but he also cant copy/paste a patio and claim that he made it.   
If you're confident about your skills, what's the problem? 
Yes mostly Data structure or FizzBuzz type of stuff (a bit less simple than FizzBuzz)
Yep, it's standard practice, at least at companies in the Bay Area.  Mid-level JS engineer.  It's never easy coding with someone looking over your shoulder, but once you do it enough, it's not a big deal.
In my experience, coding exams show laziness in the potential employer.  It chews up a fairly large amount of time for both sides and you don't learn anything useful that you couldn't have done from looking at a portfolio.  Exams don't take into account a developers ability to learn new things, which in my opinion this is much more important.

The best hiring approach in my view is to have the candidate sit down with some of your current coders and just chat about techy stuff that the company does, if/when the candidate doesn't know something then have one of your senior guys briefly explain it and see if they can cotton on.  That way you can see how well they interact with your team, and get a glimpse of their ability to process new information.

Luckily I'm seeing a trend over the years of more and more companies realizing that a professionals time isn't worthless and actually putting some effort into making the interview process less time consuming and more beneficial.

I got myself my own hosting and domain name and then I have some friends who are interested in technopreneurship, then I make sample mock sites for them using different frameworks and any related open-source I find. Worked for me as I would be exploring more than the usual since I have more freetime at work, so I usually develop my own stuff on my hosting. Oh and I also joined LinkedIn. 
Subscribing because I'm curious but I could see this being a touch illegal for any number of reasons.
Are people really running into a large number of clients who don't pay that this is really needed? I always take a deposit upfront and have never had a problem in 2 years of freelancing.
If you built a back-door into my site and I did have a contract with you I would sue the shit out of you. No one would hire you again.
Don't you think there are better ways to address this in the future - than building a rudimentary (and potentially highly insecure) self destruct into your applications? Why don't you add milestones from the start? You're asking for trouble by giving your client it for free, without an ongoing set of milestones.

Also, what do you mean Github "project"? This is literally a few lines of code in most languages:

1. Read/test param
2. Create archive
3. Delete files (and you better hope they're using a persistent file system, not Heroku)

But again, I don't recommend doing this. 

If it were me, and you did this on my project just to protect yourself, I'd never work with you again ever because this is really insecure. If you do it, at least add a secure random number to prevent any person from just writing unpaid=true - but yikes, it is still crazy to me that you're considering it.
> Let's pretend you just did a job without a contract and your client isn't paying you, and the project is already live, and you no longer have access to the site/files.

If we're living within your hypothetical scenario, we've already missed the boat as we lacked the foresight to do anything about this proactively.

> I've always thought adding in a code-based "insurance policy" during development

If you have the time and foresight to do all of this, why wouldn't you just have created a proper contract in the first place?  Getting a contract in place should be your absolute priority (and can even cover the "self destruct sequence" you're talking about building into your code, covering yourself legally if you're ever forced to do this).

Then again, if you have a proper contract, you don't need to self-destruct anything, you just let a lawyer handle everything for you while you move on with your life.  There's no point getting bogged down in petty squabbles.
100% yes
Would love to hear your feedback on these illegal reasons.
In my situation, I actually did take full payment for the site up front. Which was paid no problem. Then more work was to be done outside of the original scope, so I invoiced them for it. They paid. Then even more work was to be done which finally led to launch. Site launched, sent final invoice, didn't pay. Their record of payment on time and my trust in that is what bit me in the butt in the end.
If there was a contract this wouldn't be needed.
unpaid=true was an example for sake of argument. It would likely be an MD5 hash so it could never be triggered accidentally.

You must not understand what Github is for if you are asking why I would put it on Github.

I have received multiple payments for this project, that lead me to believe they are trustworthy. But the last and final payment they are being reluctant to pay, probably because they are thinking the site is already live.
Isn't the lawyer likely to cost more than the contract is worth?
I get what you are saying. But putting the contract debate aside, call this "Plan B". You would be kidding yourself if you said people don't get into this situation.
Well, there could be issues if this site is a revenue driver and you clobber it. Someone might be able to make an argument under cyber crimes as this could be seen as malicious and it's also not your host. I don't know. I'm just spit balling. If someone actually knows the answer here that would be a good read.
You can always put it into collections as long as you have reasonable documentation that they owe you. The collections agency will take 33% and you can kiss that client goodbye for any future work, so you'll have to consider if it's worth it, but that may be your best option of getting paid at this point. Make sure you request payment repeatedly first, and on the third notice, give the ultimatum that if the invoice is not paid by X date, the debt will be sent to collections. I've done this once for a client who disappeared of the face of the earth for 4 months... got my money minus the 33%. My only terrible client at the very beginning of my career.
I guess when you say Github "project" I'm confused. This is a gist of a few lines that you can write in most languages in a few mins.
Professionalism is important. If they don't pay you, walk away. The amount you've been short changed isn't worth the potential poor reputation. 

For this customer, by all means be assertive that they have not followed a agreement.  say that you won't be working for them in the future and that since they haven't paid you fully they shouldn't expect any free or discounted services if they have any issues. 

Now think about how you can better communicate project costs and milestones. In the future, make sure they sign off on each milestone. 
You don't need a lawyer in small claims court. You don't need to really do shit for small claims other than file, show up and show your proof. When they can't show proof of payment to complete the contact, the court will automatically side with you. Now collecting is where you might run into issues, but at that point you could let a collection agency take care of that. Sure you won't get as much money, but they can harass the hell of them to get the money.
Likely, just writing the contract and getting signatures from both parties would reduce the likelihood this requires a lawyer in the first place.
> Isn't the lawyer likely to cost more than the contract is worth?

Don't you think that will depend on the contract itself?

That said: No, I don't generally expect the lawyer fee will exceed the worth of the contract, especially if the contract specifically includes covering legal feels of the winner.
> You would be kidding yourself if you said people don't get into this situation.

Yes, people get into this situation... but getting into "this situation", which includes the lack of a contract, also included the lack of foresight to acquire a contract.  As such, I doubt such parties are interested in any extra effort to put self destruct mechanisms in place either, because these are the people sitting around at the end of it all saying:  "Shit, I don't have a contract, and now they haven't paid me and I no longer have access."

So no, I don't think taking the time to implement self destruct mechanisms is the right approach, I think having a fair and correctly formed contract is the right approach.
Totally. I'm not challenging that there aren't possible legal issues, I just don't know what they would be exactly and how they would hold up.

I mean in a contract-less project what would the judge go on if it went to court? You could easily just say using this "unpaid mode library" is in your typical workflow on all new sites. If the client doesn't pay under verbal/email agreed times/amounts, the site goes into "unpaid mode", this is standard procedure for how you work. For example.
My point in putting on Github is the primary objective of Github - social coding. I don't believe what I write can't be improved upon. Someone may have a better way of doing it - maybe fewer lines, better security, faster speed, customizing a function so that you can pass it options of what to place into the index.html file, etc. Maybe I'm thinking a little bigger picture than you.
The thought could come mid-project, not necessarily at the end when you no longer have access. So after you've already started without contract and before you no longer have access. Let's say the client has been paying regularly but hasn't paid the last couple invoices. You get nervous. You could implement this at that point. Just playing devil's advocate.
Good luck (and I wouldn't worry too much about speed, it's a path  you'll call a single time, so probably not worth you or anyone else spending too much time optimizing the runtime speed).
If you want my honest opinion:  If you don't have a contract in place and you pull something like this you could very well get sued yourself (contract's protect both parties, and lacking one could find you in a very messy situation, especially if you go nuclear like this).

Also consider that putting something like this in place, completely outside the scope of the project you're working on for the client, could end up placing you in hot water (contract or not, unless the contract specifically allows for it) as one can make the very realistic argument that you developed beyond the scope of the project and purposefully built in vulnerabilities the client didn't request.

Put more succinctly:  Doing something like this is inviting legal trouble while not really protecting you from anything.
Except for when people find out you put self destructs into your sites, then you stop getting business at all. Esp. from clients that are already stand up ones. They won't tolerate that kind of stuff. Learn your lesson and always get a contract. In the mean time gather whatever correspondences you can, that mention pricing, work to be completed, work that was completed, etc and file in small claims court.
> Also consider that putting something like this in place, completely outside the scope of the project you're working on for the client, could end up placing you in hot water (contract or not, unless the contract specifically allows for it) as one can make the very realistic argument that you developed beyond the scope of the project and purposefully built in vulnerabilities the client didn't request.

On this, not necessarily if it's just another library you use in your typical workflow.
How successful would a developer be to sue a client for unpaid invoices on a contract-less project? Or what are some other options for getting paid on a contract-less project?

I'm not saying one should ever use something like this lightly. I would hope the developer would fully assess the situation they are in. If my client was Nike, of course, I would never even think of doing this. But a lot of the time contract-less projects are very low key, low budget projects. At least they seem to be with me in my handful I've gotten myself in. A friend of a friend wants me to do their underwater basket weaving website. If I'm getting stiffed on a couple thousand dollars and I'm not hearing back from this person, I would probably go ahead with this method. Then they would contact me. I would explain what happened. The site goes into "unpaid" mode if I'm not paid in full after launch. From this point, I would assume they would just pay. At least the clients that I've deal with in contract-less situations don't seem like the type of people that would start a lawsuit, they would probably be quicker to think this is just typical process if they don't pay. So I guess my point is that you would really need to assess the client you would use this on, and it wouldn't be something you could use on everyone.
I think you overestimate the technical knowledge of most judges (and juries... not to mention lawyers).
The size of the client is irrelevant, you should always have a contract.  This is as much for the client as it is for you.  The contract exists to define the structure and requirements from the relationship.  Most/All of this can be boilerplate, but it still needs to exist.

How successful anyone would be in litigation could literally be a coin toss unless there is a contract to reference.
I completely understand the contract argument. That being said, I'm looking for creative/critical thinking for developers who do find themselves in this situation, not just the perpetual hind-sight advice of "you should have a contract".
> I'm looking for creative/critical thinking for developers who do find themselves in this situation

The train of thought a developer should have in this situation, regardless of how much they feel like they want revenge or something else, is to remain professional and avoid doing anything that would have any potential to land them in legal hot water.  Self-destructing a site could very easily result in litigation (again, depending on the lack of paperwork, the outcome of that could be a coin toss).
Buy a domain, point it at a hosting proivder. Buy a plan with the hosting provider. Dump the files into the public html folder. 

I am assuming the "bot" doesn't require configuration, if it does you need someone to look at the code and set it up.

No, you don't need the 15" one if you don't care about screen size. The one thing I did spring for was a 13" Pro, as I wanted two external monitor output ports, not one (like the Air has).

For the processor, web development does not typically tax the processor like video transcoding does, so it's not as critical.

Make sure you read the [Buyer's Guide](http://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Mac) to figure out when to buy.
I just switched from 15" to 13" retina and I like it! You can choose the pixel size from the settings. Setting it to the smallest, the resolution is pretty much the same as it was on my 15". It still looks retina though, because pixels are so small compared to the old screens.

Highly recommend the 13" retina model. New force touch keyboard is also nice, and it's really small compared to the old 13" models.
Keep in mind the new ones are unibody ... And they are ridiculous to crack open and swap parts. 

As a dev or even web dev you won't need a ton of space, I highly recommend spending that money to max out the RAM and get the model with the better battery life. 
I do web development and web ops and since purchasing a MacBook I haven't used my MacBook Pro 15" or iMac. 

It may not be as fast, but it's always by my side. The MacBook simply has a great ratio of utility :: availability :: capability. That really makes for a transformative creative tool. As a web developer, it does everything I need a computer to do.

I also really enjoy the confines of the screen size and performance. It helps me think of design and development from a mobile first perspective.
Thank you! didn't realize there was a website like that. 
Thanks! Yeah, the 13" one looks more than enough for what I'd do. 
The reason I was going to swap out the ssd was because I had a spare one from my desktop. I didn't realize that Macbooks got harder to open. Also just found out that RAM can't be upgraded at all, which is a bummer :/ Thanks!
Yeah the more I see my friends and co-workers use it the more I think it's really suited for my needs. The combination of good battery life, great screen, good enough speed, and OS X makes it seem more than worth it
I learned the same thing the hard way with the MacMini I bought a few months ago. Have to pay an authorized repair place $50 to put my SSD into it in order to not void warranty...
I just got a 15" retina pro and so far places like iFixit rate it as one of the worst to DIY work on lol. According to them, their DIY Rating is 1/10.
This is an ambitious project if you're just starting out. Is this really the first project you want to work on?

I'd pick Python (with Flask or Django) or Ruby (with Rails), but not both.

I probably could write several pages of responses for you, but let me give you a few highlights:

- you'll need a basic user auth system to allow login/signups (there are often simple libraries that do most of this for you)
- then you'll need to design your key tables to store the data (users, sounds available to buy, etc) in a relational database
- You should think about how the sound will be stored, whether you'll have a player, and how much DRM matters to you; if anyone can upload, you should think about if you'll be transcoding to a common format, or if you'll restrict what can be uploaded
- you'll need a payment system, probably using Stripe, and potentially a way to pay back out to the people listing on your site (maybe using PayPal?)
WordPress would definitely not be the platform to build this on. I'm an avid WordPress fan for a variety of reasons but this project would not be a good fit.

You would want to build a custom app using some sort of framework. Rails would be a decent one since you mentioned it. You might also want to build it out as a SPA in some parts, which means lots of JS.

The biggest thing you'll need to keep in mind is that data storage and streaming is going to cost you a small fortune if you're using something like Amazon S3. Streaming costs significantly more than storage on S3 so keep that in mind when you are trying to find a pricing model.
Thank you!  This is exactly what I was looking for.  I understand it's ambitious, but it isn't my first project.  It is a bit more in depth then previous ones I have worked.  

I wanted to get a better idea of what I will be looking at later down the road for a website like the ones I listed.  I know it all won't come together overnight, especially since I have another project that I am finishing up.

I appreciate you taking the time to offer your insight on this!
Thanks for the reply!  I have heard that streaming can become very costly, and hope to figure a way to drive down this cost if possible.  Rather than stream entire audio files, I hope to have sample clips available for stream, then after purchasing the full version can be downloaded.  DRM is not an issue; simple download and it's yours.
No worries, and happy to help if you want to ping me in the future.
For all intents and purposes, amazon considers downloads as streams since you are downloading the file via HTTP. So even if you only have clips, the cost may still be fairly high!

Good luck :)

I love your New Moon theme. Thanks for it. I use it on my Linux laptop for brackets and it feels great on binge coding nights.
You have a fantastic blog! I'll definitely be adding it to my RSS list.
your blog is really excellent thank you for all the work!
this is a great list, i would personally add https://egghead.io/ to it as well

Awesome! :) I should do an email signup, but I figure everyone else hates emails as much as I do. Also ads, or any type of extraneous junk.
Awesome! It's my daily driver. Every now and then I try to throw some variety in, but no other theme is as easy on my eyes and I always switch it back. So much so that I made it available for all the major code editors just in case I need to use a different one.
You're welcome. :)
Strange thing, that website was blank for 3 seconds after it "loaded" then it faded in. Waiting for the font to load, maybe? I am an impatient man.
I just use RSS :D
I wouldn't mind an email notifier as long as there's no pop up for it! Also just want to say I loved your blog about getting Wordpress up and running, very clear and easy to follow 
Perfect!
I'd saw off my own foot before I voluntarily put a pop up on a website. I'd definitely make it a small, discrete link. :) And thanks! I'm working on a part 2 for that article. 
I'd normally write a thoughtful post on how all jobs are hard at first, and that you need to take some time to learn more before getting frustrated.

In your case, though, I'd highly recommend seeing what else is out there (see what else is out there, don't just quit in frustration without assessing whether you'll get a new job easily). You list a lot of issues, but the ones that particularly worry me are:

- You're not doing much coding, and it doesn't seem likely that you will, which means you won't learn much
- It doesn't seem like you have a mentor, and you probably need someone good to get better

If you do stay, I'd have a chat with your boss about how best to communicate about your offshore team when you're not the dev - it could be as simple as your boss being upfront that there are other developers, and that you're simply the one who talks to them. 

If you're early in your career, I'd really recommend optimizing good mentors over money, as it'll make you a much better coder which will help in the long run.

This is not what any job should look like. Dude, get out of it. You know it's not normal, and you shouldn't feel that way. You don't owe anyone anything. Never feel bad about leaving something awful to pursue something better. You're smart, you'll find something.
Quit ASAP. You're not gaining anything by suffering through your work like that. 
Decisions are always easier when you already know the correct answers, right?   
   
*  If you want to be a developer, and you aren't developing, then it isn't a good fit.
*  If you are getting paid as an entry-level developer, but doing the job of a dev manager (or at least account manager, interacting with the customer), this job is not rewarding you appropriately
*  If you are looking for a strong mentor but have a boss who is willing to throw you under the bus for his mistakes, this is not a good fit (for anyone, not just you)

Quit
> My boss said nothing. My boss did nothing. This was something my boss did despite my telling him not to, and he sat back and let me take the heat for it all. 

The way people work in corporate environments is rather unfortunate... Moving up is often about taking undeserved credit / blaming others... I would just use the rest of your time at this job (while you look for another) to practice this game. Don't accept blame for things... If your boss is treating you poorly say so and refuse to stand for it. Tell him no when he makes stupid decisions and if he pushes it be very clear that its on him. 

Sometimes you have to just lay your dick on the table (not literally...(or literally once you find a new job ))
[deleted]
> Should I start looking for another job now?

Yes.

Also, your boss doesn't shield you from the clients' heat? And lies to clients? And is generally a shit head to you and not supporting you at all? And pays you peanuts for all of this?

Why are you still going to the office again?

Also, the whole offshore/outsourcing deal and you taking the fall for all of that reeks. This is a big red flag in my book. Same with your boss fumbling around with the code base and adding features willy-nilly without consulting anybody (including the client!) first.

> [...] what a web development job should look like or usually looks like [...]

It certainly does not look like that. Not by a long shoot.

Sorry to say, but you will never be happy at your current job. Get out if you can. It is a toxic environment. 

Best of luck.
Dude, i havent read through the entire story, but this line of work ahould be filled with people who are passionate and enthusiastic. Your boss is killing your passion and enthusiasm.

Search for another job please. And if your boss is going to make a hassle out of it, please ruin him. I can already imagine what kind of boss he is and i have worked with some of them and i wish nothing good to become of them.

Save your passion and enthusiasm and leave that place.
>My boss tells people I am the developer because he doesn't want people to know he outsources. This really sucks because it means I take the heat for all of the mistakes and stuff. Our customers are very unhappy with us (understandable!) and are really nasty to me. My last meeting with the customers brought me close to tears, and I don't cry easy. As it is, I think I've cried through my lunch break a handful of times.

Holy shit, quit. You'd rather be on well fare than staining your career like that.
You know what to do.  Wasn't even worth the time to type this up dude.  Leave. Now!
If you have a good command of html/css/sql just start applying right now. Collect the check and learn a lesson from this, not all companies and bosses have your back. Don't quit collect the check and leave at the next opp. Tell the interviewers about your skill set and how you apply it logical to scenarios they are asking you about. You can tell potential it was more content driven focus than developing  or don't tell them you are somewhere. Also keep the boss being an A hole to yourself  AS A CANDIDATE YOU WANT TO BE THE BEST OPTION. get out of a toxic scenario.
If you hate your job, find a new one.  If people tell you that your opinions are wrong or that "all jobs suck", tell them to go piss up a rope.

But, it is important to find a new one before leaving the old one.  Use this as a learning experience, now you know a few more things to ask about (tactfully) in your next interviews, and warning signs for bad places to work and bad jobs.

As others have said, job interviews are two way.  You are interviewing them every bit as much as they are interviewing you.  If they act like that's not the case, huge red flag.
Man this reminds me of me getting my start. Don't feel bad about looking for other gigs while you've still got the job. Top comment is spot on: find a place with good mentors, also that has documented happy clients. Those are the people you want to learn from. There's nothing worse than having clients screaming at you. It's not just about places that do good work, it's also about places that pick good clients. Oftentimes there are account and project managers that stand as a buffer between devs and clients which is really nice. Look for something like that, if possible. Not a bad question to ask during an interview - what their setup is re: project managers, account managers, and Dev. Also demonstrates a little knowledge of standard agency structure. 
[deleted]
Hey man, worked in a similar position to you when I started out. I didn't know what the standard was, I mean it was my first job and I had no degree/work experience so I took what I could get.

But I started to think that web dev was not for me. Fortunately eventually I had enough, quit, fortunately got picked up by an amazing design firm and LOVING life and work right now.

Jobs shouldn't be terrible, especially in our field, I would strongly encourage you to take the leap bro <3
[deleted]
This sounds awful. Your boss is a wannabe. Get out yesterday.
Well... what did you expect when taking a shitty, underpaid job? Get out of there asap.
It seems its out of your hands to make your job enjoyable so I'd look for a new job, I've never understood people who stay in jobs they hate in any industry (well except those with minimal qualifications and don't have a choice) But you've got valueable skills so won't struggle to find a job, a job you enjoy aswell! 
Start looking for a new job.
It sounds like you mainly just have a bad boss. A popular solution to this problem is recorded in the documentary "Horrible Bosses".
Check out www.launchdigitalmarketing.com or www.dealerinspire.com   !!Chicagoland area office and do remote work.
You have to leave but try not to burn bridges (even if you know you're never coming back). Find a new job, give two weeks notice. Don't badmouth your last place at your interview, just say what you worked on. Allow yourself to smile when you tell your old boss you're leaving... but don't be cruel about it!
Work on your code/portfolio in your spare time and apply to any job that interests you.

In terms of how to improve your code, I'd take a look at these resources:

**HTML/CSS**

* http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/
* http://learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/

**Javascript**

* http://javascriptbook.com/

**PHP/MySQL**

* http://www.amazon.co.uk/Learning-PHP-MySQL-JavaScript-Javascript/dp/1491918667

Or look online for any good resources for whatever technology you want to get into.

Good luck :)
I would have quit a long long time ago. Learn to ferret out these sorts of things during your interviews. 
Honestly everything you need to know has already been added by others; however, I'll add this...


At your age the fact you are still new in the field I don't think that is going to be a detractor for a potential company to hire you.  (referring to the comments about making sure to have a min 6 months experience at the job)

If you were 45 years old and have a resume with a ton of 6 month or 1 year jobs if I was looking for something long term that would raise a flag but someone in their early 20's with a job or 2 under their belt with limited experience I would most likely chalk up to figuring out what you want to do in the workforce.

Based on my assumption above I would ask appropriate questions during the interview to make sure you weren't a total hack who is just being constantly fired because you are faking your skills and are just a good talker. 

Assuming you made it past the questions I'd followup with some questions about what you are looking for in a potential employer/job situation to make sure you would be a good fit - I wouldn't want to hire someone who is looking for something completely different then what we offer.
Get the fuck out, bro. You don't deserve this shit, no one does.
Your boss is a motivated, driven idiot.  They are in big numbers because a lot of really stupid people are so naive that they're stupid (or don't care) that they plow forward and create work casualties.  Before you go, ask yourself "what is the idiot doing to be so successful?"   What's his industry?  Can you do it?  Create your own business NOW before you get used to working for someone else.  FUCK THAT.   Live your life as your own boss.   IT'S NOT AS HARD AS YOU THINK if you just work smart.  YOU CAN DO IT.  Hit me up on MSG if you want to know more, specifically.
Definitely start looking for a new role. One way to get better at development is to work with a good developer and learn from them. Look for companies that are more likely to have good developers. 

I would recommend a successful mid-size design agency or the like. Ask how long their developers have been working there in the interview and look for people who have been there 1-4 years to target as mentors.  No guarantee they'll be good devs, but it's more likely. If they've been there more than 4-5 years, then chances are they've stalled or stagnated since they should have moved on to a larger company / role by then. Avoid those people unless you're confident they're actually good devs.

Focus on a specific part of development that your mentor is good at (Front-end, Back-end, one language, etc). Don't bite off more than you can chew in the first year.
Dude, leave. Where do you live?
I had a job almost as shitty as that one. I quit with no notice. Some jobs don't deserve any notice.
Your BOSS is the problem; not you, not the "outsourcers," not your customers, etc. Most importantly, not YOU! A good boss wouldn't allow this situation to occur. Unless you can go over your boss's head, you can only look for another gig. I've done the same, and it's really empowering when you realize your career is in *your* hands, not those of incompetent management. Not easy, but suck it up and update your resume. Good luck!
Personal opinion of course, and there are some great other pieces of advice in here  - but put update your resume (and portfolio/github/website if you have) and start looking for a new job now. Also, if or when you try to look for something new **do not** bad mouth this current place, if you are asked about it keep it simple and positive about your responsibilities and what you learned and so on. I'm sure you have some pent up feelings about this place but the last thing you want to do is shit talk an old employer to a new one in any way.

That sucks though - I worked in a start up fresh out of college for a guy kind of like that, me and some friends that worked there have war stories from some of the crazy shit he did and terrible ways he rand the business (like seriously fucking nuts, a totally ego driven alpha male type of guy who had to be in charge of stuff he had no idea about). I will say - it was really good experience and I learned a ton though, but it sounds like you don't even really get that there, so in my opinion - start looking for a new job and posting your resume now.
I'm going to go against the grain here a bit, because of the fact that you said this is your first job.  First, what kind of education/training do you have?  If you have no formal programmer training, leaving this job so soon may not be the best thing for you.  If it was hard to get *this* job then it'll be harder to get something better.

Instead, use this as an opportunity to do something.  If all you do is communicate with the offshore team, does that mean you have a lot of extra free time?  Use that time to look for opportunities to identify manual processes of the business and implement your own solutions.  For example, develop automated tests which expose just HOW shitty the app is.  The moment a feature breaks, notify your boss that the offshore team broke something.  If you're boss still doesn't listen, consider speaking to their superior, explaining the work you have done.  Most of all, put these solutions on your resume, and use them to sell yourself to your next job.

The other thing you should do is start attending user groups.  That is where you can find mentors.  That is also where you can network, which will help you find less shitty opportunities.  Prioritize becoming a part of the software community over making any impression on your current job.


> I am the only web dev at my company

I didn't need to read any further to know you shouldn't work there if you want to grow. 

* You have no one to pick up new things from. The most concentrated learning period in my career is when I was a junior developer put on a team where every single person knew more than me. 

* You have no one to help you catch your mistakes. For example, I worked on a codebase built by clueless offshore guys that left the app wide open for SQL injection. Without me it would have launched like that. Who will be there to stop you from doing things you don't know yet you shouldn't do?

* Your superiors don't know anything about web development, so they don't understand what you offer them, what to expect from you, how long things should take, etc.  The day you work under a manager who's an ex-developer you'll never go back. 

* You work directly with clients. Clients are awful. Let a project manager who signed up for that deal with them. The day you have one of these you'll never go back. 

Most of us started where you are, and if things stayed that way we would have changed careers. It sucks. Just make sure your next job has fewer red flags. 
[deleted]
Did I not see this exact same post like a month ago?
We aren't developer but a client. We've been using toptal for a while. Very happy with them.  The devs seem to be happy too. Maybe it's a job alternative for you. 
Not in a situation like this but how do you find a job with good mentors? 
Thank you. For some reason I really needed to hear the words, "You don't owe anyone anything." today. You and everyone else who responded have really brightened up a terrible Monday. Thank you.


I disagree. He should wait until he's been there for 6 months so he can put it on his resume as a short-term contract.
Don't quit. Find a new job first.
Well, maybe OP wants to suffer some now to build up an immunity...
Thank you for breaking it down like this, I am going to commit these three points to memory. 
What do you think will happen if I push back or make a stand? I really have no experience in this area at all. 

I don't know what to do in the customer meetings. On one hand, that's when I tend to get shit on the most. But I don't want to speak up and throw him under the bus right in front of our clients.

How would you handle this, if you were me?
Thank you. 
>Why are you still going to the office again?

I didn't want to mention all of this in one thread, but if you go here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/40kjnv/my_mil_45_f_helped_me_22_f_land_a_job_at_her/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/40kjnv/my_mil_45_f_helped_me_22_f_land_a_job_at_her/) you'll see why I'm more reluctant to quit than I would normally be.

Thank you for your advice. 
I don't need to ruin him, he's ruining himself pretty well on his own. At the rate we are going, there's nobody in the entire metroplex who will hire him for future projects. Better off with a copy of Websites for Dummies from 2004.
Believe me, that thought runs through my mind more than once during the workday. We work with clients who would make excellent contacts, but because they're having such a bad experience with us, I know I will never be able to put them down as a reference. It really sucks.
Straight to the point, and you're right - I guess I do know what to do I'm just afraid to do it. Thank you for the words of encouragement.
Thank you for the advice. Yes I'll continue to collect the check for sure. The only thing that keeps me sane at this job is thinking about that check. 

Thank you.
Thank you very much. I definitely did not interview my boss before accepting this job, and I ignored many red flags. A lesson learned the hard way. 

Also, first time I've heard the expression "go piss up a rope." :)
I'm located in the Dallas area. 

Thank you. I really hope I don't get tired of web dev, I love it so much. 
Glassdoor.com does exactly that. Though keep in mind these type of sites get honeydicked by HR from those companies posting fake positive "reviews".
Yeah, I know. A lesson learned the hard way. I'll never be so naive again, that's for sure.

Thanks, I will try.
Thank you. I don't know about valuable skills. I'm entry level. HTML, CSS (some Bootstrap, familiar with SASS), intermediate JS (and some framework experience), enough PHP to develop for Wordpress, Drupal, and Joomla. However I've seen a few job postings that call for exactly these things and less.
I've never seen that movie but I'm going to have to this weekend. :)
Do you work for them?
Thank you. Yes, I definitely will learn to recognize the red flags and say no to people when it doesn't feel right.
Thank you for the agency advice. I'll start beefing up my resume in the coming weeks. 
Outside of DFW. I could probably comfortably commute to anywhere in the Dallas area - or, as comfortably as one can be in such a populated area. I would rather avoid south of Dallas - though I don't see many job postings for S. Dallas anyway.
How long did you work at the shitty job, and do you put it on resumes? I'm sorry you had to experience that. 
>it's really empowering when you realize your career is in your hands

I can't even imagine feeling that way, I feel so trapped and frustrated right now. It is good to know that it gets better. Thank you for the encouragement and well wishes!
Yeah, not a lot of learning is happening at my current job - not any related to web development, and not a whole lot at all. 

Thanks for the advice on keeping things positive and not bad mouthing my current employer. I've heard that a lot. Do you think I should avoid any details that might be unflattering to my current employer? I'm struggling to think of an example at this moment, but suppose I'm asked about my current responsibilities and stuff. Or challenges. Keep it light, steer away from anything that makes the interviewer wonder "wtf?" when it comes to my current company?

I *guess* an example would be using Microsoft Word to make design mockups. Avoid this detail altogether? 
Sadly, not a lot of free time at all. The offshore team develops the cms theme and "custom plugins", but I'm in charge of the content, a task that is much more time consuming than I ever thought possible. Probably not helped by the fact that there are innumerable typos and silly errors on a site so large that combing through it takes every hour that I have. Maybe it will not always be this way. When I ask my boss how the typos and stuff got there in the first place he gives me half answers. I suspect the developers do it or he does. 

My boss doesn't have a superior. He's *the* boss, and owner. It's a small company. I could have stated that, sorry. I just didn't want to overwhelm people with information.

I really like your idea of finding solutions and then putting it on my resume, so I will pushpushpush to see if maybe my boss will give me a chance to do this. I am not trying to be negative and shoot down everything you say - since you said a lot of really awesome stuff I hadn't even thought of - but I doubt he will give me a chance judging by his pattern of behavior. But that doesn't mean I couldn't do some stuff in my off time. 

I've just begun going to meetups and I've met some interesting people! I will keep doing this as much as I possibly can, it's been much more educational than my time at my job. 


Evidence of what? Just quit. Hell, don't show up and get fired. Why would you incur attorney's fees for quitting?
Can you tell me why you needed an employment attorney? I am so new to the ways of the world - this is my first "grown up job" and I have no idea what an employment attorney is for. Did your ex-boss try to ruin your reputation?
Are you spam? If not, can you provide more info about Toptal?
Interviews are NOT just answering questions, ask questions, who will I be working with, what tech stack is currently implemented, what new technologies are you investigating to work with in the future. Ask if it's possible to meet the team before accepting an offer if you get to that stage and this is important to you.
Let's first define some characteristic of good mentorship:

- The person is competent in what they do
- The person is a good teacher (can explain things, is patient, etc.)
- The person (or company) values mentorship (cares about you getting better - ideally derives substantial value from that)
- There are processes to ensure ongoing feedback (e.g., weekly code reviews, pair programming)

Some ways to find good mentors:

- Look at what some of the best web devs you know did early in their careers
- Find consulting firms that have domain experts, e.g., [Pivotal](www.pivotal.io) or [Thoughtbot](www.thoughtbot.com) are some of the top places to learn
- Stalk great posters on Reddit or Hacker News and see where they work
- Join an open source project with developers you respect 
(Others, feel free to pipe in)

Some other links:

- [Stack Overflow: How to find a Programming Mentor](http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/28651/how-to-find-a-programming-mentor)
- [Hacker News: How Can I Find a Mentor](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7693954)

That's the right question
Don't be afraid. You can do it. :)

I once had a job where someone fell on the ice on my day off and my boss blamed me. Also I was the kitchen manager, and ice outside had nothing to do with me at all. I realized I didn't deserve to be treated that way, and mustered up the courage to quit that job and career and never look back. 

It's easy to worry about the future, but realistically - this is not the only job or opportunity you'll ever have. You'll make it through, be happier, and be proud that you stuck up for yourself.

And every time I have to make a tough decision, I ask myself...

What's the worst that can happen? Will anyone die as a result of my actions? Will the world end as a result of my decision? Probably not.
What's worse is that you're learning all the wrong ways to do things here.  They're actively corrupting you whether or not you realize it.  The longer you stay at a place like this the less likely you will be adaptable to how things *should* be done.  

I almost never recommend packing things up and quitting but this one is really bad, especially for someone new in their career.
I've always looked at work this way for the most part: An employer will almost always let an employee go if it's the right thing to do for the company. Then why should an employee think twice to leave a company if it's the right thing to do for the employee? 

Sometimes we can allow ourselves to believe that they are doing us a favor by allowing us to work for them. However it's a two way street. They pay us to work to work there, but in return the business is earning money on the work we do. 

Long story short: Don't be afraid to do what's right for YOU. 
Can I do that? It isn't technically a short-term contract, it's a full time position. That's a different thing right?

Can you explain further? 
How can you be sure someone who runs their business like that would be a worthwhile contact though? Who knows, with how they are treating this entire situation maybe they'd even try to burn OP for leaving.
Not really, but maybe a positive thing about this experience will be developing a thicker skin! 
Don't even allow yourself to think in that direction. 

This job is not good for you and you need to leave it asap. Don't try to change it from the inside it's not going to happen. And don't try to redeem yourself. It's not necessary and it won't help you. Spend that energy on moving forward. 

And start coding every evening at home and get ready for that next job. 

You seem like a good person who is loyal. Don't lose that aspect of yourself but at the same time use that loyalty at a place that's worth it. 

Good thing about Web Development is that you can teach yourself and float up through hard work and determination. So keep pushing on and you'll get there but don't waste time on sub optimal situations. 

Good luck! 
None of this should be done in front of clients. If he just throws you under the bus to clients then tell him he is doing this, tell him you dont want to attend the meetings if he is going to do this. Be firm with him. Tell him you want more control over the projects if your going to be held accountable.
Hi webdevnewbie,

Sorry to hear that you are in such a predicament. And sorry that I sounded a bit angry in my comment, I didn't mean to. (I am quite easily upset with stories like yours, because I hate seeing people in bad situation like that.)

I am not really sure what other advice I can give you in your situation. But personally, I would not worry too much about the MiL, because after all, it is your life and your career. Your MiL should not have much say in that, to be honest. 

In any case, I don't think your MiL could say or think anything bad if you just tell her the truth? Not sure on what terms you are with her.

And if she does not understand that, then maybe your partner can talk some sense into their mom.

The other option would be to just find a better paying gig and tell your MiL that you would be happy to stay at her friend's place but they could not / would not match your new place in terms of salary. Just as an idea. Not sure.

Anyway, best of luck to you and again, sorry for sounding a bit harsh.
Yeah, the ruining was maybe  a bit too much, but your story reminded me of my previous job. The company is growing ever since, but only because there are new 'newbies' who consider him to be a good boss for the first three months..

I wish he'd meet someone who is a bigger asshole than he is.


Anyway, good luck with whatever you decide to do. The fact you are thinking like this already makes all the difference. You are bound to find a great spot at an awesome studio/company. 
Haha, glad I could add something new to your vocabulary.

Good luck with the job hunt!
Yes and I would use a site like this, but my company is really small with so few employees and little turnover - so there would be no question about who posted the review. 
Those are skills in the world of web development my friend!
yup. great company culture. work hard. play harder.
Mine wasn't as shitty as the one described here. I actually got to write a lot of code. I did put it on my resume. I worked there for a year and a half. I had to listen to the boss yell at everybody and make racist comments in the office all day. At one point he hired some guy at an exorbitant salary and just from what his code looked like it was obvious he was outsourcing his own job to multiple different people. The app I worked on stored credit card data and passwords in clear text and you could find the database username/password online. I and another guy were cleaning up this mess without letting the boss know, so we felt sort of like the good guys in the midst of a disaster. However, my paycheck bounced 4 times. That's why I quit.
Personally I wouldn't try to fix the problems at work - if you're in a content management position, that's just more work beyond what you're already doing. I'd research the tech that's going to get you the job you want, whether that be more backend or front end stuff. Then build a sexy portfolio site, and throw some code samples on Github. (Doesn't have to be earth shattering, just make sure it's decent.) Then you're already head and shoulders above the riff raft. 
Give it a try, learning to convince difficult people that spending some of your work time doing something that will benefit the company is an important skill to learn in software.

If you can't get your boss to warm up though, invest your time in growing your career outside of work.  Unless your boss warms to your ideas, this job does not sound like it is going to grow your career at all in software, and unless you can pull out some positive, constructive things you did, at best it won't add any value and at worst it will be a *negative* on your resume.  Blaming everything on your boss or deriding the outsourced programmer's code in an interview wouldn't be a good idea either, as you are the one who took the job and stayed there.

If you don't have a formal education or training, your best bet is to network in the software community while working on your skills.  Having your own projects/code on github is a bonus, but honestly the majority of software jobs are not going to be accessible to you simply because you have github code.  I am interviewing people with college degrees, boot camp training and many projects on github and that still doesn't necessarily get them the job.  How are you going to stand out against a candidate such as that?  By networking.  Otherwise, the best jobs you can hope for are ones like your current one.
I'm not associsted with toptal other than being client. We have been a client for a couple months. They have a process that protects both client and dev. There's a toptal tech engineer who is our main contact. He had meeting with us understanding what we want, then match some devs for us for an interview. We had to pay a deposit which was fair to me because there are some bad people out there who don't pay. For us, once we interviewed a candidate and like what we see, we had a one week trial with the candidate, which we can reject at the end if we don't like it. So far so good. It's not cheap for sure. Our site uses ruby, rail, nosql, mongodb. Dev we hired is a full stacked guy, very knowledgeable.  Other than the high costs we spent, not much complaint. Our use name is the domain. Feel free to check it out. According to them, they only hire 3% of devs who applied. The technical skills we experienced from devs are very good.
I found an "apprenticeship" position which was a 3 month contract at a digital agency. They basically gave me a trial by fire and let me build custom drupal modules and a lot of front end work as long as I could prove I could handle it. I dont think its for everyone but it definitely sent me to the next level career wise

edit: Also didnt mention that they paired me with 2 different programmers whom I could ask any/all questions to
Adding to this thoughtbot mention, they have a learning app called upcase, which in absence of mentorship opportunity can be a pretty dang good surrogate. It's mostly for rails though. I work alone and gain a lot of value from going through upcase.

Getting blamed for ice on your day off...??? Your old boss sounds worse than mine. 

Thank you, that really puts it into perspective.
Thank you. I hope I'm not learning too many bad habits but I am sure that I am, ones I'm not even aware of yet. 
The way you put this has really opened my eyes. Thanks. 
I used to read resumes as part of my job. If I see a 6-month time period I just assume that it was a short-term contract unless you tell me otherwise. You don't have to lie, nor do you have to tell me what's wrong with the current job. Just briefly say that you're looking for a better fit during the interview. 

In fact, I know people whom I respect a lot that always get a new employer at the end of every 6 month to 2 year project. Their theory was that every new job came with a 5K increase in their salary.

Also, **don't quit before finding a new job**. People in general are far more likely to hire someone who is currently employed. 

You've stated exactly what I am worried about. I am afraid to even put this job down, which sucks because it is my first and only web development job.
>And don't try to redeem yourself.

Funny that until you said that, I didn't even realize that that's what I've been trying to do - to my boss, and to the clients who hate me. Thank you for that, you've just granted me a lot of freedom (from trying to prove myself to these people who are determined/destined to dislike me). 

I don't know if I'm exceptionally loyal, but I do tend to put up with people and situations for longer than I should. I have doormat tendencies. 

Thank you for your advice and words of encouragement, they have really cheered me up. :)



Yes, you're so right. Thanks for your advice.
That is comforting to hear. I feel like an impostor most of the time. :)
That is a nightmare (the cc data in clear text). 
>if you're in a content management position, that's just more work beyond what you're already doing

My thoughts exactly, I am exhausted as it is and still not meeting their impossible deadlines/expectations. 

Thank you. Sexy portfolio and code samples are my next tasks to do - then freelancing while I search for a new job, I think.

Thank you for your advice. 
Thank you.
Yeah I did something similar. Not for everyone but definitely launched my career. If you find the right team and can afford it, it's definitely a good way to go. 
Best of luck to you, I'm sure there's a job out there that will make you much happier!
What about providing references to my old job? Do I have to do that? Do people typically contact the current employer?
What is 6 months good for? It sounds like a red flag for someone likely to jump ship just as they've learned all they could from your company...?
Putting down your current job is better than including nothing at all. If a potential employer asks for contact information, you could always refuse - it's quite normal to say that you don't want your current employer being contacted. They usually won't bother asking for contact info if they're not interested in hiring you. They may give you an offer stipulated only on verification of your previous employment. You can decide whether to give them a contact based on the situation.
We all do :(
You're very welcome. Good luck! When you land an actual Dev job with a legit place, you will be much, much happier (and saner!) 
My fingers are crossed. :)
Where do you live? If you are in the US, your employer is legally prohibited from saying anything bad about you. Most will merely confirm whether or not you worked for them.

I would expect HR to check prior employers just to make sure you weren't lying about your job history. Mostly its my HR department calling your HR department. Your manager may not even know you are looking, and certainly (again, in the US) can't legally punish you if he does find out.
It's a common contract term.
It's a common contract term.
Thank you, I don't know why but for some reason I thought I couldn't refuse to provide contact info. Of course they could always look my company up and call them without my involvement but it sounds like this is a big no-no.
Cross your fingers, but also don't forget that your actions will play a huge part in what happens next. This might sound scary, but it's actually empowering because you, not anyone else has full control over what your future holds. 
My company is so small that it doesn't have an HR department. The person who would answer the phone would probably be my boss's/the owner's wife. Do you think that changes anything and if so, how do you suggest I handle it?

Thank you, by the way, for sharing your unique insight. 
>  If you are in the US, your employer is legally prohibited from saying anything bad about you

While that is technically true that the employer cannot say negative things; the question "Would you hire this person again" is a valid question that can be asked as long as it doesn't go beyond YES or NO

If a previous employer says NO; then a good and legal followup question would be the documented reason for them leaving their current post.

While digging any deeper would certainly put you in jeopardy its easy enough to get a good feel about a candidate with just a few questions.  Most companies won't lie about their employees history to try and block you from hiring them (IE- they won't say they won't rehire just to try and prevent you from doing it)


Yes, but this doesn't sound like a contract. It sounds like these are regular employees:

>In fact, I know people whom I respect a lot that always get a new employer at the end of every 6 month to 2 year project. Their theory was that every new job came with a 5K increase in their salary.

What can they contribute in 6 months? How much of that time do they spend getting up to speed?
You can provide other proof that you worked there if necessary. 

And if another HR department is calling your current employer you almost certainly have the job anyway so does it even matter if your boss finds out? 
If you're still employed with a small place while interviewing, you make sure to tell them that. "I'm still working there so please don't contact them". Make sure to have other references.
I'm not sure how others around here feel, but you may want to look at contacting a recruiter. If you don't want your employer to know you're looking you can tell the recruiter. 

Most places using a recruiter to higher you won't even check your references if you do well in the interview.
Tread carefully. Really small companies can tricky and don't always know the rules, let alone follow them.
I wouldn't worry too much about that. I left a very small company with no HR dept and prospective employers are very sensitive about where you are currently employed.
They are hired from the start of the project, so ramp up time isn't an issue for them.

That said, my specialty is being dropped into failing projects. It rarely takes me more than a couple of weeks to get up to speed. By the end of six months I've usually ripped out massive sections of the core architecture and replaced it with something that's actually maintainable. (Maintainable as in any noob can add new features without breaking it. Not maintainable as in every class is abstract and every constructor hidden behind a DI framework.)
>And if another HR department is calling your current employer you almost certainly have the job anyway so does it even matter if your boss finds out? 

I never thought about it like that. This is my first full time, salaried position with a company so I'm not familiar with the HR process and things like that.

What would another proof be? Check stub? Something else?
This. Also, there's no big sin in saying something along the lines of "My current position isn't a very good fit. It turns out they are needing more of a general content management person whereas I'm looking for more of a development role." If it comes up during an interview. Demonstrates that you're not just a job jumper, that you're committed to your craft, while not saying anything bad about your current employer. I've definitely said something similar and gotten the job. Better to be straight up than be over polite and omit things or sweat having a 3 month vs a 6 month stint. 
>Most places using a recruiter to higher you won't even check your references if you do well in the interview.

Why is this? Do recruiters check your references so employers don't  have to?

This is a dumb question but just making sure - even with a recruiter I still interview with the employer right? I don't interview with the recruiter.

Yeah, I don't know much about recruiters as you can probably tell. But I will definitely look into getting one and the benefits of them and all of that. 
Wonderful. :/ 

Maybe I should just get a few freelance clients to fall in love with me, reference them, and leave this job out completely? I don't think I can count on my company to follow the rules. 
I hope so. It makes me very nervous, because if they call my current employer and then I don't get the job...well, I imagine it would be really awkward to say the least. 
Check stub or an employment contract you may have. W2?

I don't know about others but if I were hiring someone and someone said, "Hey, look, I'm not currently happy about my current employer so I'd appreciate it if you didn't contact them as to not cause any conflicts" I'd let them prove their employment some other way.
It really depends on the recruiter. A lot of times they will vet you, I've had a couple, and one of them I actually went in and had a face to face with them. I believe that's more rare, usually you'll just have phone conversations.

From my experience, 99% of the time you will interview with the company hiring you. They pay the recruiter to check your references,  etc...

That being said, you can be completely honest with most recruiters, they are there to sell you, not sell something to you. They want to know as much as they can. You can say something like "I'm at my first 'professional' job and I feel like I could move on to something better." You can even tell them about your current employment, and give them the rundown on why you are so unhappy. 

Some people may have different advice about this, but I've never had an issue telling a recruiter how I really feel about a company. Something you DO NOT want to do in an interview.

I think I've answered your questions, if you have more feel free to ask. I'm not the best at typing things out like this, I'm a little more handy when it comes to solving problems, lol.
Why not? 
Super late but wanted to comment.

Most places are not going to call your previous employers. They will call your references. Unless you're getting into something dangerous or governmental they won't look to hard at your past. They will just want to know if you can do the job.

In general, you're being used. I'm sure you get that. Your boss has no respect for or values development. To the point they he's lied to your face and then admitted it.

> I hired you and called you a developer so I could mislead my customers.

~ Some General Tips ~

Document Everything. The only way you can confront a shitty boss is showing them how they contradicted themselves. Or you're at least be able to cover your ass when somebody asks why you did something.

Time Tracking. There are tons of tools out there. Find a few buckets to put your work into. Especially rework. After a bit you'll have a nice report of how much time you have spent reworking things because the boss did something dumb. If you ever present that to anybody remind them how much that costs. The number you use is what your company charges per hour - not what you make per hour.

Ask less. Just start doing things. Test the water a bit. Start small. Find where the limits are. Boss says do X and you think Y is better then do Y. When confronted be positive.

> I did some research and it looked like Y was going to meet customer's needs better so I went with that.

You may get a talking to now and again. But there is a good chance the likelihood of you getting fired is slim. Hard to tell though. I've found most places like this are at either end of the spectrum. They will either fire you for nothing or they're all bark and no bit.
awkward isn't a terrible worst case scenario
Thanks. I wonder if many other employers would be willing to do this. It's worth a shot.
Your answers rock, thank you.

I might get in touch with a recruiter in the coming weeks, so it is good to know that I can be frank with them.
Thanks!
No, I think the worst case scenario is that I start getting treated worse by my current employer. Cold shoulder, even heavier workload, ostracized from any social interaction that happens in the workplace. I hope that this wouldn't happen though.
Haha nice!

Okay, as far as the being frank with them, just be careful. Obviously don't just come out and say "God, I hate working for the company I'm with, what a bunch of dicks."

That won't look good. ;)

Just be honest when they ask why you're looking. More honest than an interview. 

Also, good recruiters know the managers at the companies they are placing people with. It's good to have a good idea of what the people you are interviewing with will be like.
Thanks for the advice. :)
i just use [stylish](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fjnbnpbmkenffdnngjfgmeleoegfcffe) to set it for all sites

	* {
		tab-size: 4;
	}
That's why I hate when devs use tabs
Ahh the old tab vs space question. I was tabs all the way until I started working with other devs. Now it's all about the IDE settings. Set your tab to 2 spaces peeps and your PR QA peeps will love you!
The obvious way to fix the tab vs spaces issue is to just remove all whitespace and learn to read code in one line.
I feel you. I made this because browsing anything other than Ruby code (Go especially!) was super annoying to read. ðŸ‘Œ
So if someone used 8 spaces as indentation you wouldn't have a problem?

The real way to fix this is for all software to use a more sensible default for a tab (4 spaces wide is most common). Then for the minority of people who prefer 2 or 3 or 8 wide, they can change it.
Definitely haha not knocking it or anything. Great work man
I wouldn't. Only because github/bitbucket would render that consistently. From my experience, tabs make PRs harder to review when working with a team of devs.
> tabs make PRs harder to review

How so? A tab is a tab, they don't mess up diffs like spaces so often do when changing alignment.
The only time this happened was when I was working with a design agency handling their code for them. Everything was going well then the agency owner handed control of outsourcing over to his wife. She was a crazy bitch that had no technical skills and thought that calling us several times a day to put pressure on us was the best way to get good work. She started bad mouthing us to people we knew so I confronted her about it and said she needed to find a new developer and just pay us for what we had done so far. She then changed her attitude just long enough for us to finish but soon as it was finished started bad mouthing us again and what was a good relationship with the agency owner soured and became uncomfortable as our offices were practically next door to each other.

I'm usually good at spotting when people will be trouble and getting out ASAP but when you get a switcheroo like that you can't really see it coming. I try to factor into my pricing a margin of error that will allow me to take a small financial hit to just get out of bad deals before it gets too bad. A little bit of extra cash isn't worth stress or enemies.
I haven't had any personal experience with this (thank the gods) but anyone who answers differently than "I had a contract. My lawyer dealt with it." was doing something wrong. 
Whatever you choose to do, remember the Streisand effect. 
Yes - just ignore it assuming it's something petty. The people who matter will know your reputation, most social content can be removed or ignored ... And if it's anything dramatic or threatening you can have a lawyer send a ceast and desist for about $35 
Can you explain the last part? Like do you have a base minimum of "pay this much to get my attention."
Had to look that up. Thanks
That's assuming both signed a contract?
I try to account for the fact that once in a while a project will turn sour through no fault of my own. When it happens I will get out of it as amicably as possible even if it involves me not getting paid. I spent a year once working on a project where the client was an absolute nightmare. A nice guy and well meaning just very difficult to work with. I really wish I had cut it short after a few months and not tried to stick it out. Now if I get someone like that I will either try to finish outstanding work and not take any new work or worst case scenario refund deposit and move on. This just means I have to be pretty firm with my rate and keep enough money in reserve to cover situations like this.
It doesn't happen often and lots of projects have their stressful moments but some people are just impossible to work with. It's also demotivating for me working on something which I know is shit and the client will eventually realise is shit but my hands are tied because they have given explicit instructions to make it shit. It gets to the point you have to keep a log of all the conversations you have with them as at a point down the road they start blaming you for all the crappy requirements you explicitly warned them against.

After 13 years in the business I'd rather just nip it in the bud early on and walk away. It's projects like that which make people change careers.
Nope. Slander or Libel ... Both are against the law and enforceable. 
Talking about Yahoo? No I'm joking... regarding the last bit.

This is good thank you for sharing.

I'm not sure what "impossible to work with" is... talking competence? Stubborness? I think the purpose of this website I'm working on now is flawed, and will ultimately lead to nothing... but I'm still working on it... not sure if that's a bad sign. 13 years. Gives me hope. Would be nice to have a long track record like that. It's a fun field, problem solving.
That is if it's false right? Yeah slander, and libel both are defined as false okay.
That client in particular would call up and talk for an hour about what he wanted but refuse to write anything down so I would write up the requirements based on the call and email it to him as a record. Every day he would have a new idea that would have a massive impact on development and would insist it had to be in the next build. I was managing 3 full time developers just for this project and the client wouldn't listen to my recommendations. He became confrontational and was just looking for issues and would put the blame onto me for his money worries that were affecting his family while at the same time employing other agencies for stupid amounts to do overlapping work and try to play us off against each other.

At the end we made a really nice piece of software that I was proud of but getting there was the most stressful time of my life and it really didn't have to be stressful at all. It cost the client double what is should have and I didn't really make that much out of it.

Some clients though seem to just get it. They ask advice and don't have unreasonable expectations. Some clients appreciate good work and don't spit their dummy out at the first problem. However a bad client throwing a tantrum can take up so much time that you end up neglecting the good clients.

When I was running that agency I learned it was important to cut away the bad clients, even if you are short of work. If you have spare time then over deliver on projects of people you enjoy working with and it will pay off in repeat business and referrals.

lol ... If you suck and its true then reputation management should be the last concern!
Perceived reality is better than the real thing... hahaha
I think angular after the first load is great.  So freaking fast
Yep! . I will post the code in a week. You can take a look at it. in the meantime checkout my other related tutorials here which is the data for this article:

It's just a couple drop down menus with hover effects. You can do this with JavaScript or Ajax to keep it simple. 
Since this is Reddit I'm going to give you my *super duper opinionated answer*!

* You need to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in that order.  HTML + CSS should take just a short time to grasp (maybe an hour or two of reading some docs/howtos and editing some actual HTML/CSS).  Don't *touch* jQuery yet and add `-jquery` to all your Google searches so you don't get stuck in the "every solution is a jQuery plugin" anti-actually-learning-something rut.
* Once you can make a self-contained web page that, say, displays text in columns and can mix & match images with a decent (dynamic) flow you'll need to move on to *server programming*.  I highly recommend Python for this...  Even though you've just taught yourself JavaScript and could--in theory--just use JavaScript on the server via NodeJS.  Python is going to be a lot easier for a beginner to grok in terms of "when I hit this URL it returns *this* result" than the async complexities of NodeJS coding.  Try this as a good start: http://flask.pocoo.org/
* Learn Linux.  I'm *dead* serious.  Basically every publicly-facing website runs on Linux these days.  Microsoft still holds some ground inside enterprises but that is quickly degrading due to the costs and complete inability to automate Windows (i.e. spin up a dozen "cloud instances" without having to manually configure anything).  The future of the web is running on Linux.  Heck, Microsoft's fastest-growing business right now is Linux instances running on Azure!

Hopefully that's a good start.  Good luck!  Google and Stack Overflow are your friends.

Great resource for all your questions. 
W3schools
thank you. great info. Do you recommend any sites to learn HTML, CSS and JavaScript?
This is great - I echo everything here. I'd really concentrate on HTML/CSS at first, and do spend some time on front-end tooling (google things like emmet and linters).
thanks!
oh you don't say? I'm trying to have a conversation w someone not just read words
Yes, *your own site*. Get started already!

Make an .html file and load it in your browser. Keep editing it until you have something resembling a site!
A really popular, if bareboned one is: [W3Schools](http://www.w3schools.com/)

CodeAcademy and others have good frontend courses.
let me ask you this. I did some UI development for a mobile app and basically I would create what the website looks like on Sketch and transfer it to code. Is that a good route to go or should I use wordpress or something with templates?
>trying to have a conversation

>not just read words

A 'conversation' where you're asking people where to find web dev resources... to read...

Gotcha. 



No.  W3schools is toxic.

Use mdn instead for reference information.  It's up to date and accurate unlike w3s.

Another good resource is caniuse.  I use it pretty much weekly.
It's up to you - one way is to use pre-existing templates like Bootstrap or the wrapbootstrap.com themes, or an edited WordPress template. The other is to create designs and then manually code.

The easier approach is the first, but you get more customization with the second.
My bias is still to use W3Schools at first as a basic tutorial, it's quick and short. Then, MDN is a great reference.
ok set let's say I use a wrapbootstrap theme. Do I make the website through wordpress or something or use dreamweaver and do it myself with an index.html? I don't know code that well so I'd like to do the easier way but still make it look *good*
If you don't know code well, you can customize it with a GUI based editor like Dreamweaver. Or just use a professional WordPress template that you customize however you do so today.
so wordpress is best route huh?
Once I had desire to make something similar but for facebook friends. Good job, looks fun :)
Care to share the source code? It looks good :). 
That's a really good idea
Sure. It's a bit of a mess since I wrote the whole thing up in a few days but here it is: [github](https://github.com/YuryBecker/network)
I guess I gave you the idea where to expand your map, would be a popular application I'm sure. ;)
Why not all of them? 
SkipTheDrive has listings for all of those. They specialize in telecommuting jobs.
Here's a some questions to help learn a bit more and narrow things:  What database(s) are you using?  What language/framework(s) can you work with?  Do you specialize in any particular?  Where are you located (as in if U.S. what city/state)?

You sound a lot like me.  I slogged through building HTML/CSS sites for years and hated it and STILL hate it.  I own a company with 2 other partners and we deal a lot with phone apps.  I still have to do lots of front end web stuff but do a lot of DB/API work specifically for custom phone apps.  I'd recommend potentially marketing yourself to app developers who want to build more complex apps but might not have the knowledge of working with web environments or external databases.  Depending on your responses to my questions above (and many many other factors of course....) I could consider farming something out to you.  Then again convincing my partners (and myself) to trust a stranger on the internet doesn't sound fun.
Team up with a FED and split the profit. 
You need to find some ecommerce clients 
Hey,

> what database(s) are you using?

Most of my production work is done is MySQL. I have used Mongo in a couple projects too.

> What language/framework(s) can you work with?

Primarily PHP and Python. Loving Laravel atm.

> Do you specialize in any particular? 

Not sure how to answer this. Everyday I learn something new but I can deliver a complete project.

>Where are you located (as in if U.S. what city/state)?

Toronto, Canada

If you do consider farming stuff out we can do a short project together to see how we fit :D

thanks!

When I was writing the web services chapter in my textbook (*Fundamentals of Web Development*), I faced a similar challenge. I wanted a set of APIs that would be free, stable, interesting, useful in the context of the case studies used in the book, and still available in a few years. I ended up using Google geocoding api, Microsoft Bing Maps API, and the flickr API.
This is incredible!
WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT This is amazing!

Professional web developers can charge up to $100 or more in some markets. I charge $75, typically.

The less computer literate the client is, the more expensive the custom project will be (admin tools need to be more highly automated and whoopsie-proof; some extra meeting time required to talk them out of using blinking text on the front-end; etc.).

Allowing video uploading requires someone to be available to verify nothing illegal is being uploaded. A 3rd-party transcoding service will cost extra. A content delivery network will charge you money. A 3rd-party media player will probably charge you money. A payment processor may charge you money beyond transaction fees.

In other words, all of those costs either have to be included in a monthly or quarterly maintenance SLA that you client pays you (potentially risky in case of traffic spikes), or those bills go directly to him - just like hosting and domain name registration.

Professional design could run up to $3000 by itself (or more), with programming, testing, iterating, testing, iterating, testing, and launch on top of that.

If a client came to me with this, I would let him know the monthly cost estimate based on his expected traffic (video transcoding, media storage and delivery, hosting and bandwidth, etc.), and that he is looking at $7500 minimum. With a pre-existing HTML/CSS/JS theme already designed or purchased, he could save a couple thousand.

If he balks at that price, then he is possibly just looking for Vimeo or YouTube and needs to be shown how to work the enterprise features.
Never discount something because you think it will be good for your portfolio.  Customers take advantage of that mindset and even if you don't do it, every other week you will have someone saying "I can't pay much but this will be great for your portfolio!".  Along with "I can't pay much but we can work out a profit share deal later on!" etc.

Charge whatever you think makes it worth your time to do it.  If it ends up being great for your portfolio at the end, that's icing on the cake.
You can put anything into a portfolio so long as it shows your abilities. It could be a blog/website/application.

It's difficult to freelance where you are a one stop shop because that means dealing with everything. If you can't say no, then I'd recommend that you stop freelancing or doing work for people on the side. From here on out get yourself a contract to give to clients with clear goals/payment terms. 

As far as this guy goes, you don't work for free anymore. Do whatever you promised to do in your emails (you wrote it down so it's a contract now) and then let him know you will no longer be providing services.
The tools you need to write to handle the video encoding/delivery alone are 5k. Even offloading it to encoding.com is $70 a month which is double his current cost of hosting
haha 5 grand that's hilarious (no offense) I don't know what I'm doing with this person, I'm literally explaining every step, how to add a new theme on wordpress, and I don't even use wordpress... ugghhh. 

&bnsp;

What about your own competence, you can't charge for the  cost to figure something out right? You should already know what/have it in the bag.

&nbsp;

Thanks for your input
Wow this was a great response. That's what I'm saying he's like "It doesn't sound that complicated" and I'm like "Yeah that's because you don't know how it works." I didn't know about the real time filtering. I assumed you needed a way to filter malicious content. You're talking probably adult rated stuff right? Maybe Amazon Mechanical Turk. Could you break down your price reasoning further?
I'm not sure what to do at this point. Dump him, or what. I don't know. There is no money involved. This person takes a bus to get to places, I don't even know if they work. Oh man... What do I do?!!! Hahaha
The problem now becomes, my name was tacked onto every email communication between us. How would I professionally end this. That's the thing I don't believe it will end. I have to spoon feed him everything. How to use Libre Office in lieu of Word, how to use paint, how to point the domain to my server, how to add a new theme in WordPress, etc... Like every next step is a question asked to me. Can't think for himself... Oh man... I guess if I decided to take down the directory for his site, despite his domain pointing to my address, I really wouldn't be taking away anything right? I mean what you mentioned in your response is what he's trying to do and I've idiotically said I would do it "for experience" so why am I bitching right? I'm a yes man. My life is full of excuses, why I can't be with that girl. Why I am where I am now. Oh man... Well I guess what I will do is... Grow a sack and tell him the details. What you are trying to do requires knowledge or money. Since you appear to have neither, I don't know what to do. These features have to be managed by professionals as I am not responsible for that. You have to pay for that. Since you can barely use WordPress, I don't you'll be able to manage these services.
Regarding my skills, I'm a basic developer, full stack, but I don't know everything off the back of my hand. How much do I cost based on my experience you think per hour? I could go off of salary desired... Currently I think I might break $20,000.00 a year so if I could do that doing web design, and possibly better, that would be great.


Thanks for your response
I doubt the computer illiterate guy wants custom code to handle the encoding. I think OP should steer him towards Vimeo or AWS.
you can laugh all you like, good luck living off that $30.

Honestly it seems like you're taking on a project thats too large for you... in terms of both experience and client-handling ability.

Theres a lot more to a project then just jumping in and building something. Theres planning, documentation, paperwork, support (phone calls, emails, client guidance), setups, installations, etc.

A lot of things will have to go into factoring out a good quote for someone, not just the time you think to build the code.
> What about your own competence, you can't charge for the cost to figure something out right? You should already know what/have it in the bag.

This is like the entire job.  There isn't a single day that goes by where I don't have to google something.  The client doesn't know a thing about development and isn't willing to learn.  The fact that you are willing to wade this stuff to build them a project is reason enough for you to be paid.

DO NOT DO THIS WORK FOR FREE.  Unless you are building a site for your church's bakesale make sure to charge and get paid adequately for this job.  You will hate your life after you put in 100 hours of work into this 'portfolio' site and don't have some compensation coming your way.
Filtering doesn't necessarily need to be real-time, but using Mechanical Turk would be a great way to handle content review. I'm referring to illegal stuff and anything that would go against your terms of service for the site and for any 3rd-party service you're involving (video conversion, CDN, cloud storage, etc.).

A really simplified breakdown might be as follows:

* $2000 (estimated) design w/2 revisions
* $1125 (15 hours) conversion to HTML/CSS/JS (from PSD or AI or whatever)
* $750 (10 hours) behaviour and layout revisions based on HTML prototype
  * yes, this can take this long, and it's an important step
  * you are never going to be right on the first try
* $3625 minimum for everything else
  * framework research selection
  * development and staging/demo environment setup
  * project management, meetings,  and planning overhead
  * actual programming
  * revisions, revisions, revisions

I wouldn't even do this as a fixed budget project. This should be done as a fixed scope project requiring $7500 minimum, maximum of 30% more. Expected cost would be between $8500 and $9000. Select a date range to aim for (best case date and drop-dead date) and make sure you can dedicate 100 hours to the project within that time frame.

If the site becomes more popular than you predicted, you may want to prepare your client for the possibility of throwing another chunk of money at things in order to scale it out (hopefully you will have left yourself the ability to do this relatively easily during initial development though).
Just pick a number you think you'd be happy with.  If he turns it down, oh well, there are always more clients.
If you want to terminate the business relationship, don't be insulting about it.  Just make something up like, "Due to other commitments I can longer provide you with the services you need.  I will be available for support for the next 30 days at $X/hour, but after that you'll need to find someone else to help you."

Do not shut off his website without giving him fair warning and a chance to move it elsewhere, in fact help him do that if he wants to.  If he owns the website, you shutting it off without warning is probably illegal even if it is hosted on your servers.
Stop acting like your client should know how to manage DNS records. That is not common knowledge, sure you can google it.. But man be professional, and stop looking down at your clients for them not knowing technology. People will hate working with you if you don't change your mindset. 

EDIT: Also stop publicly insulting your clients, have some respect for your clients and yourself. You can tell with how you type you also don't have much self confidence. You have a lot of interpersonal relationship things to work out.   
If it were me (and take this with a grain of salt because I don't freelance) I would look at market cost for web developers in your city. Look up job postings and see the hourly rate. Then estimate how long the project would take and do some multiplication. Factor in things like hosting costs, maintenance in the future, training employees, etc. All of that should be billed. $20,000 a year is less than a cook would make on minimum wage. I'd really start researching running your business if you want to do well (and you should). Good luck to you.
Yeah I'm not laughing at the cost you mentioned, I'm laughing at myself. "I feel bad" is my problem, regarding charging people for my services. The server itself costs $3.95/mo and it would be nice to at least have them pay for the server cost. Christ... I don't know. At the same time I don't feel entirely competent to take on a real paying client so they get their money's worth.
But how much? Honestly this person sounds like they have a mental problem. The way he talks "It it it it it it it should be..." "Well I I I I I I I know it should..."  It's really bad I'm probably a huge idiot doing this but at least I have life on one of my servers. I set up multiple WordPress installs on the same server albeit following a digital ocean tutorial ha-ha... Some good has come of it. Maybe it's an ego booster if anything.
Gotaa learn some how!
I agree with this 100%, it sounds like you're jumping into a project that is going to end up with you being angry, the client being angry or better yet, you both being angry. Seems like it may be over your head and I work for a company for significantly less than you would be charging per hour with around 4 years of professional web development experience.
Yeah I have to learn how to work with HTML5 regarding the video. Regarding the project itself, the person doesn't really know what they're trying to do. It's vague. Like "It will have this, and a banner, a video will go there, peiple will do this..." But building the capability mentioned would be nice. I can add it to my code collection.
That's the thing. I don't believe that I have value. This person doesn't have money but there project is a task that I can demonstrate as something I have solved. The problem is that the person is planning this go fund me campaign and somehow this will be used to pay, me I already know or believe that this plan is flawed from the beginning but again I need proof that I am competent with regards to coding ability.
Wow thank you so much, this is very helpful. I think based on the clients abilities and capability of learning, I will stick to using something like YouTube to avoid the filtering and storage problem. 

This cost is crazy. I'm not disagreeing with it, I just can't imagine charging someone that and they would agree, but I haven't been in this business and know what's the regular.

What did you mean by PSD / AI?
There's nothing on the website. It's a blank WordPress. I suppose the very least I can do is take the agreed $30.00 and host it for a year. Or else do something else. Man... What a pickle. Thanks for your insight. I want to explain, pretty much what he's trying to do is beyond his capabilities without a lot of money. Even if I generously built the foundation, to keep it going like the video check, payment processing fees and such, would require money. Thus putting him back to the same situation. I guess I'll list out the options.
Yeah I was concerned about that, doxing. You were talking smack about me? I want to say a client should be a paying client ha but that is my own problem I know. I believe I've decided I'm going to follow through but will specify rules.

&nbsp;

Surprisingly though I have a hell of a tolerance. But I agree, professionalism.
Now that you mention it, I do sound like a jackass. Although you may be the first to comment on my actions.
But a cook makes more than a dishwasher, which is the stage that I'm at as far as that line of work goes... at the moment I'm a data entry operator, my life is valued at $12/hr of my existence at the moment.
> At the same time I don't feel entirely competent to take on a real paying client so they get their money's worth.

So you charge a lower hourly rate than other professionals and/or you (internally) reduce your billable hours somewhat to compensate for the time you spend training yourself (while billing a relatively standard rate for a more junior developer).

I'd suggest the latter (discounting some hours for your learning curve), but billing a reasonable hourly rate.  Don't discount *all* your time spent researching/learning, however, because that's actually part of the job for most developers, no matter how senior (nobody knows *everything*, we're all learning new things all the time -- or we're stagnating).

Whatever you do, stop working for free on other people's projects.  Also, please protect yourself and your clients by having actual contracts in place (these can be very simple and still provide some basic structure).

>I don't believe that I have value.

Client needs a website, client is either unable or unwilling to build a website.  You are able and/or willing to do this job the client doesn't want to do, which means you have value to them.

That being said I can almost guarantee you if your client is using crowd funding to pay you, you will not get paid.
This is how much it costs :) $75/hour, and I figure anywhere from 70 to 100 hours to deliver, plus the cost of design. If I was doing it myself, I'd give it a 6 week timetable as well, to allow plenty of turn-around time for the designer and for waiting for the client to answer questions or make decisions.

Most (I believe) designers will deliver completed designs in either PSD (Photoshop) or AI (Illustrator) format, along with a small collection of photos, fonts, and other assets.
The reason I called you out is you have to have the mindset of trying to keep professional, even in shitty situations. There is a difference between venting and personal attack is very thin sometimes. There was no reason to call someone out for having a mental disability, this is a sign of character and close mindedness. Working with people with disabilities, this is offensive. 
I'm not sure if this is appropriate to ask you but regarding a design, this can be huge... in terms of variability. I want to expect drawings from people, like "This is what I see in my head." Even with a piece of pen and paper, or Microsoft or anything... in my case with the current client, I had to show them how to use Microsoft paint and no access to camera/scanner... so I'm not exactly sure how to handle a variable design. I guess I'll have to build something and get his input on it. Thanks for the info.
$1000? I'm assuming that's a typo? I've heard of hourly rates going up to $175, but even that seems relatively uncommon.
I don't even think they know how to take advantage if they don't even know what they're doing. Oh man. I guess this is the grown up part, deciding what to do. "I know what I said but..." Even if I followed up on what I said, how do I stop future problems, "Oh hey, good thing I caught you, I need help with this. This isn't working."
Yeah the whole thing is sketch. I don't know why I'm such an idiot. First email literally "I don't have much money." Still I have opened his eyes at least although he may have forgotten "situational dementia" I think is what he said hahaha.
Ah nice, thanks for explaining. Thank you for the reference too regarding pricing. I convinced him to go with Youtube, the rest is pretty basic stuff but I have to implement things like the ability to delete photos which I have to tie with id/rm bash just going off the top of my head. It's pretty basic overall, except that I have to design it from scratch... but nothing major, probably a javascript function or even simply css for a slideshow. The file managing part may get tricky, glob in php for the randomly-named file uploads... some kind of filtering, etc... I'm going to try and get the majority of the demo done in a day.
I agree regarding picking on someone for something they did not choose to have eg. the disability. I guess the question would be, if you knew before hand that they had a mental problem that may inhibit their ability to comprehend / make judgements, would you take them on as a client. Assuming they have money, which in this case is no... but I get the principle. Already establishing a bad reputation, nice.
It's like that thing in debates, where you pick out a person's traits/features rather than the argument at hand more than likely because you are losing the argument and resolve to a more personal matter. Like picking on the nerd in school, because the other person is dumb. I probably don't know what I'm talking about, I should just stop, each keystroke counts against me. I recall this guy I was having an argument with and I said something like "Haha who says that?" and he said what I said initially in this paragraph.
No worries dude, I just wanted you to be aware. 
No it's a good point and thank you for making that point. As I said I was being dumb. Not thinking. So I appreciate the look out. "Good looks" as the peeps would say.
I'm not too familiar with wkhtmltopdf but have worked with similar tools that generate a PDF from HTML.

Try setting 100% height on every parent element of the table (in this case, the body and html tags, don't forget the table too! To make sure you've done this correctly your table should fill the browser viewport in the HTML version). If that doesn't work, try increasing the height of the table (in whatever unit you want) and recreate the PDF until the table fills the PDF.

Thanks for the quick reply. I'm still getting the squished height. I don't get why it works perfectly for width but not height, bizarre.

I'll try your second suggestion but since users can choose different label sizes and different paper sizes (letter/A4), I feel like I already know what the outcome will be. EDIT: indeed, no cigar

I'd say it depends a lot on what stack you use.  I've recently started using Visual Studio 2015 to develop Python (Flask or Django) applications.  It's pretty nice because it has good debugging support and good support for editing HTML, CSS, and JS files.  It also has built in management for virtual environments and git integration.

The only real issue I've had was getting psycopg2 set up and working - it's very difficult to get it working right under windows.
* Firefox and/or Chrome - multiple browsers for cross-browser testing and general web surfing
* Notepad++ - text editor
* SourceTree - git client with nice gui
* Visual Studio 2015 Community Edition - ide
* KeePass - password manager
* Dropbox or whatever cloud storage you use

Sell your laptop and buy a macbook.

Getting the dev versions of chrome and FF isn't a bad idea. Git is essential, learn how to use the command line version, not that bloated piece of shit that is the Windows github client.
This is my favorite windows only tool. Especially the auto responder. 
Are you suggesting I wipe windows completely? I set up a Linux machine in my virtualbox.
I'm glad someone else said it.
I'd recommend VScode over VS2015 for web development personally, unless you're going with asp.net.

When I started learning development I was on a windows machine, I switched over to ubuntu after about a year of struggling with the windows command line and I've never looked back.

Personally I dual-boot because I still like using windows for gaming, but ubuntu has pretty much become my daily driver OS.

If you're interested in it get yourself a usb stick and make a live-persistence usb for ubuntu(or whatever distro you want) and try it for a few weeks.  If you like it dual boot, if not stick to windows.

I know you asked about windows packages for dev, but I'm just trying to save you the heartbreak that a lot of us who started working on windows experienced.

EDIT: http://www.pendrivelinux.com/ is a good place to start if you're looking to try out a linux usb ;)
Yeah, I was being somewhat facetious, but web development outside of the *nix (linux or unix, which includes osx) ecosystem is just a lot of swimming upstream. All of your tutorials, all of the demos, installation instructions, etc are going to use a *nix style command line. When you're trying to figure out why something isn't working, you'll find yourself constantly wondering if it's your configuration or installation instead of your code. 

The dual boot option is a very good idea, at the least. If you intend on using the Adobe suite at all, you'll need windows or osx, so keeping that in your back pocket is not a bad idea. 
[deleted]
I've worked with this setup as well. It works ok enough, but I inevitably find myself banging my head against terminal emulation issues. Cygwin is kind of terrible, imo. Putty is a little better when you're using it to ssh into a VM, but its still just not the same as having a first class terminal as you would on a proper Unix machine. 


Huh?

Maybe I wasn't very clear, I'm trying to do 3 things at once right now.

What I meant is that if they are using github for hosting their repos (which most people do, whether it's the best option is a different story), that they should use git in the command line, rather than use the github graphical client (which I thought was Windows only) to try and manage their repos.

Because the github graphical client is bloated and terrible, both from a usability perspective and from a performance and power (i.e. git magic) perspective.
OP (and anybody else who reads this) should consider how often they have to work with Photoshop / Illustrator files and/or Microsoft Office documents. Although alternatives like GIMP, Inkscape, and LibreOffice can sometimes do the job just fine, they often have differences and limitations. The severity of these differences and limitations range from minor to extremely major. If you rarely have to work with these kinds of files, dual-booting should be fine. But if you work with these files daily, you'll probably get sick of dual-booting real fast. You could also consider running Linux as your primary OS and running Windows in a virtual machine.
Thanks! This is exactly what I did. I immediately enjoyed my ubuntu experience, so now I'm dual-booting. Do you have any ubuntu apps/programs you can recommend?
Thanks for the info. My goal is to get comfortable with the command line, so I'll definitely be taking your advice.
What are the advantages of working in a linux machine over Windows?

Im considering changing from Windows but would like some insight on the return it provides on the amount of time invested. I manage some VPS' so I am familiar with the terminal.
Looking back, the day my Windows machine died and I installed Ubuntu for the first time to recover files from the unbootable partition was possibly the most important moment in my career as a developer.
 
Weeks later I learned just how much Windows was holding me back.
[deleted]
the product will be viewed in a web browser. it is not a desktop app. the server that runs the app will almost certainly be running Linux. I think its way more important for your development environment to approximately match your production environment than it is for you to be running Windows Chrome vs. Linux Chrome. 
You can totally use Git on the command line on windows, and very easily.  You can install Github for Windows and open a Powershell instance that has git in its path, or the hard way via Cygwin.
No problem!  And welcome to the world of Ubuntu!

Programs I recommend:

* Text Editor of your choice (sublime text <3)

*  A [terminal emulator](http://www.tecmint.com/linux-terminal-emulators/) that fits your needs.

*  [Redshift](https://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/applications/precise/gtk-redshift/) to save your eyes

*   [Turn on Workspaces](http://askubuntu.com/questions/260510/how-do-i-turn-on-workspaces-why-do-i-only-have-one-workspace)

*  You can do filezilla, but personally I think you're better off learning to run ftp and scp from the command line.

* Eventually checkout software like vagrant and docker to setup local development environments.

*  I can't remember if it comes pre-installed or not but getting familiar with [vim](https://github.com/vim/vim) or nano is also a good idea.

I'm glad you liked you're experience with ubuntu!  Make sure to check out /r/ubuntu too!
No problem, don't just take my word on it though, make a linux usb and try it out.
Personally there were a few things that convinced me to switch over to linux.

* A majority of my work is on a LAMP stack, so having my local machine also run linux helped me get used to navigating linux faster.

* Aptitude is love, aptitude is life.  Imagine having a package manager for your desktop OS, it's the greatest thing to ever happen to me.

* No need for applications like putty or cmder.  Stuff like git and ssh just work right out of the command line.

* Lots of applications just work in ubuntu, in windows I had a nightmare of a time inlcuding things like git and ssh in my path, or making sure my vhosts could handle ssh-agent forwarding etc.  With linux these things just fell in to place and let me tear my hair out worrying about something else.

My advice is the same was what I told OP.  Visit http://www.pendrivelinux.com/ and set yourself up with a linux usb and try it out.
Linux is not a "more obscure OS" when we're talking about developing web apps. 

what is the Windows partition needed for? If its browser testing that can be done using virtual machines, or even more conveniently, on browserstack.com. 
I'm a web developer in San Francisco. I visit tons of other offices all the time, and I'm friends with lots of other professional web developers. I literally know zero people who use windows for web development. Not a single one.  
  
I'm not saying they don't exist. I'm not saying you can't be a good web developer on the windows platform. I'm not saying that there's anything inherently wrong with using windows for web development.   
  
But what I am saying is that there's a wealth of knowledge, a tremendous number of tools and utilities, and a host of other invaluable resources that benefit the modern web developer immensely that are only useful or available on *nix platforms. 
I have seen Firefox / Chrome render something differently on Linux vs Windows vs Mac and sometimes that difference is big enough to make the design look broken even though it looks fine on Linux. It's rare, but it happens.
[deleted]
I'm well aware you can use git on the command line, I'm suggesting that OP does use git on the command line, and ignores github tools entirely.
[deleted]
You've never met a .NET developer? Not even one?

As a counterpoint, everyone in our office uses all three operating systems: Macs machines running Linux (via Vagrant, usually) for development, and a Windows VM when we need to do .NET work.

My only additions would be Webstorm as and IDE, and Beyond Compare. Maybe Source Tree for Git - while I often use the command line on Mac / Linux, I don't when I'm in Windows, and Source Tree is a pretty decent free GUI for Git.
[deleted]
If you don't get this you are under qualified to be offering advice to would be developers.
>As previously stated it's needed for programs like Adobe. Photoshop, Illustrator, ect.

These are aspects that are much more related to design then development.  In fact most of your argument has been geared towards windows design capabilities instead of actual development.

All the software OP has mentioned has been geared towards the actual coding aspect too, so we decided to propose an OS that has significantly more tools then the one he's on.  

>everybody is doing OP a disservice by recommending he switch to a more obscure OS than just becoming a better developer.

So while he's busy struggling away on putty and cmder should he also switch over to gimp instead of photoshop so he can become a better designer?  That statement makes no damn sense.

If he is new to development and coding, he is going to encounter less roadblocks on a linux system then he would on a windows system.
Actually, no. They're a super rare breed in my neck of the woods. 
No of course I'm talking about osx, but given the choice between windows or just plain linux, I would advocate running linux as your primary OS. Learn to use a linux box. Most likely, every server you ever hit will be a linux box. 
[deleted]
[deleted]
>I'll reassert the point that if OP is posting here asking for help on his Windows computer he should stick to Windows OR Mac.

So instead of just experimenting with a linux OS he should go out and buy a new Mac?  You are entirely basing your reasoning on Adobe products.  OP asked about development, not desgn.  If he was a .NET dev I would tell him to stick to his guns, but he's obviously coding for a linux platform so the .net argument is gone.  You're arguments would have some merit if OP had mentioned anything about design but he hasn't.  Can you bring up anything that has to do with **development** and not **design**?
Not at all about a windows vs mac argument, but you're saying windows and osx are equivalent in their usefulness to a web developer, and my point is that's far, far from the case. In order, I would argue the most useful oses for a web developer are osx, linux, and then windows. That's all I'm saying: windows is basically the third world when it comes to web development. Linux will get you a lot farther, and unless you're doing graphic design also, it'll get you all the way. Nothing to do with win vs osx.

Find other people to take over those clients.
Find some developers who would love to work on those projects. 

Tell your clients that you are transitioning out of freelancing but would recommend these developers who will easily be able to take over their project, and you will personally speak to them regarding it, free of charge. 

They will happily switch to someone you recommend.
What sort of stuff were you developing in what tech?
What sort of projects are they?
This
Very good advice. In doing this for 10+ years I agree with everything listed, with the exception of the personal site. YMMV but I've never had a single client ask to look at mine. Doesn't hurt if you have time for it, but I think it's normal for devs to be so busy with work that they don't have their own site. The barefoot children of a cobbler.
* If you're working with a client currently but are getting offers to freelance for other people, how would it be best to handle the situation?

* Also if you're a full stack developer and feel pretty confident in being able to develop a complete website, what should you be charging for your services?

* Also if I'm promoting my services through freelancing, should I try to estimate a quote for how much it's going to cost for every customer or try to do "bundle packages" where the client can buy "5 static pages for X amount" for example

Thanks, this article was really insightful!
[deleted]
All great points!
It's more for building your skill that anything. Side projects suffice as well. The point is to always be experimenting which is something you can't always do on the client's dime.
> If you're working with a client currently but are getting offers to freelance for other people, how would it be best to handle the situation?

This is usually an indication that you are under-charging. Increase your rate both for your existing client and the new client. Your time is at a premium and when demand for it increases, so should the cost. If you don't feel comfortable raising your rate for your existing client (although you *need to get comfortable* ASAP), then use this opportunity to quote a much higher rate to the potential new clients than you would normally feel comfortable quoting. If they turn you down outright and disengage, no big deal, you still have your current client. More likely they will accept it and you will feel silly for charging your existing clients so little. Just be careful to not overextend yourself. If the money is so good you can't refuse, then it might be time to start subcontracting your work out. Before you know it you might be running your own shop. I never got there because I had trust issues, but I regret not taking that step.

> Also if you're a full stack developer and feel pretty confident in being able to develop a complete website, what should you be charging for your services?

It obviously depends on a wide variety of factors and there's no number I could give you that would make any sense. My guess is, though, whatever you're charging right now is way too little. There aren't many people out there who can full-stack develop *and* interact with clients well. If you really want a number, shoot for $100/hr since it's nice and round and symbolic. It says "I'm not a sub-$100/hr guy, so if that's what you're looking for, you'll need to find someone ***cheaper***". Ever notice how people who buy $200 pairs of jeans justify it by saying they're "comfortable"? Perceived value is a powerful thing. You want to be Calvin Kleins, not Wranglers.

> Also if I'm promoting my services through freelancing, should I try to estimate a quote for how much it's going to cost for every customer or try to do "bundle packages" where the client can buy "5 static pages for X amount" for example

You want to sell your clients **solutions**, not *stuff*. Don't break it down by number of pages or try to come up with some sort of package/formula, because then they will try to marginalize you by treating your output like widgets. Clients don't want "5 static pages for X amount", they want **solutions to their business problems**. They want more customers, or a better ranking on google, or higher customer satisfaction, etc. Focus on discovering what their problems are and providing solutions to those problems. Steer them away from haggling over number of pages, lines of code, or quantity of features. Think about their business from their perspective and use your expertise to help them reach their goals. Think about it; if you solve a problem that increases their revenue by 10%, it doesn't matter how many lines of code you wrote or pages you created. You should ask for half of that 10% because without you, it wouldn't exist in the first place.

Hope that all makes sense, and good luck!

Face to face is key. There are so few developers out that who have good interpersonal skills that it's very easy to set yourself apart from the crowd. Good luck!
Thanks for the reply, it was really helpful. Really appreciate your insight!
Already noticing this. I'm a developer coming from a business background and the skills are translating over very well
Oh, man, you're very well positioned. Kill it!
This happened to one of the sites I maintain after a recent WP update. The theme is using **query_posts()** and was passing **offset => '0'** or **offset => ''** in the params. Removing the **offset** parameter fixed the problem. According to [WP docs](https://codex.wordpress.org/Making_Custom_Queries_using_Offset_and_Pagination) if **offset** is passed it overrides pagination.
All of that work, frustration and seven smashed monitors just to find out I had to delete one arg.

Thank you so much for your reply. I have wasted so much time on this. Although I did find some depreciated code that I was able to update. Well, everything is working as it should now. Even my monitor. ;-)
Glad I could help. I wasted about 30 minutes on this but I zeroed in on it pretty fast because the theme my client's site is using has had similar issues in the past.
Nicely done! I think this will be a great resource for the team and help to facilitate the discussion on how we should handle specificity in our CSS. I had no idea about the box-shadow one.
Bookmark worthy
Specificity rules suck. It would be better if it would just get applied when it gets parsed. This is madness.
Just wanna say that [I use Firefox](http://caniuse.com/#search=clip-path).
Thank you. Please keep in mind just because it works it doesn't mean it's a good pattern (.spy.spy.spy.spy EEK).

Also, if you're depending on browser painting to override then you might want to look upstream.
Thank you!
I think that would be even more maddening. Sometimes specificity is useful. If you have a standard convention of naming your classes, like BEM, then most things should be the same specificity anyway and get applied as they are parsed.
People are always saying this, but it just wouldn't work. If you have

    p { color: #444; }
    .special { color: #a00; }

Then on one particular page you want to override the default paragraph color, you can do

    p { color: #000; }

But without specificity, now you're also overriding the `.special` class and any other class or attribute applied to a paragraph.
yep. The spec doesn't even have correct examples.
Yep, boxes aren't as fun :(
>If you have a standard convention of naming your classes, like BEM, then most things should be the same specificity anyway and get applied as they are parsed.

Yeah and what's the point of specificity if like you said `most things should be the same specificity anyway`?

These specificity rules are unintuitive. You sometimes use some third party CSS and would like to tweak it a tiny bit without changing the actual source. Now you don't now the selectors used in that code and you will therefore just use `!important` which sucks.

I think applying it in the order it gets parsed would be more logical. You would have your general styles at the beginning and then gradually start to become more specific. Inline styles should be parsed after the regular CSS and still be able to overwrite it.
That's an interesting argument. I haven't done a design where the defaults change per page yet. I like it consistent.

What about `p:not(.special){ color: #000; }`? If you have many classes and don't want to include them all you could also use `p:not([class])`.
The point I was trying to make here is that the functionality you want, later rules overwriting earlier ones, already works in CSS. I understand your point of view where in most cases you want later css to take precedent but say you want to be an earlier selector to take precedence than a later one. Specificity allows this. 

Your example about third party css is a bit lazy. In order to overwrite that style correctly you should overwrite the selector that the third party is using. If going through the source is too difficult you can inspect in your web browser and see the full selector they are using.
Interesting perspective. With BEM the classes shouldn't be overwriting each other so their particular specificity shouldn't matter.

Unfortunately, most 3rd party css is pretty aggressive and hard to scale though version upgrades :(
> I haven't done a design where the defaults change per page yet.

Doesn't have to be per page. Any element inside a block would override everything. For example `article p {}` as the third rule would always override `.special`.

> If you have many classes and don't want to include them all you could also use p:not([class]).

But that only tackles classes, not IDs, attributes, or any of the various other selectors.

Probably depends on what country or local jurisdiction you come under. I would say that from a data protection perspective, ensure your client requests that the system must explicitly seek permission to release personal data to background check companies, and that the contractor may decline this if they wish. (One approach if the checks are mandatory is to refuse to continue with a wizard-type form if they do not tick a box).

Certainly in the UK/EU doing this without permission ("Thanks for your data, we're now sending it to spooky people X") is an invitation for legal trouble.

I'm looking at checkr now.  They have the API documented on the site, which is nice.
Its a US company with events around the country.

If the website performed any automated background check, I would only incorporate it if they explicitly informed users of such action.
Great stuff!

In my long career, I have only been part of one truly successful, beating deadlines, awesome tech-stack project.  Ironically, that project was destroyed intentionally when a competitor laid down multi-millions to buy it out.

I've been part of many projects at large clients that were clown-shows of the first magnitude.  In these settings, no idea which has merit can survive, and there is almost a mandated stupidity. 

Having a leader in authority who is also a developer can save the project from many ills.  Else, it's like the proverbial virgin teaching sex, and the egos won't allow reason to enter discussions.
I've heard stories from my clients about past projects that has convinced me that there are development companies out there that know full well that they aren't trying to make a real product. They exist to extract money from clients and seem to feel that word of mouth is an unnecessarily expensive thing to maintain.
To be fair, some clients have... very high expectations given the quality of their 'ideas'.
Haha, jokes on them, I work at a SAAS startup, we don't even have projects!
Worked on government workflow software until 2 years ago, when development was going on for already 10 years and I don't think it is finished yet or ever will. Probably six different teams worked on it and now it is a blob of several hundreds MB of $coffee code nobody understands.
  
It runs though. Kind of. Not always. Never good.
I've seen both sides of the fence on the same project. 

Started a significant site rebuild/replatforming (tertiary ed, so plenty of stakeholders, integrations, expectations, budgetary concerns etc). 

18 months down the line we were signing NDAs and parting ways with a vendor who could absolutely not deliver what they said they could. They didn't understand the problem domain, couldn't grasp the business processes and so on. It ended pretty poorly. 

Rebooted the same project on an open source platform after convincing various directors that OS was not just viable, but in our case preferable. 

We now have what I'd call a successful project. A solid platform to build on, delivered on time and with no additional cost on top of man hours. Well received, continues to perform really well and meets the needs of the various business units.

If that's the only successful project I work on in my career I'll be disappointed, but good to have at least one under the belt. Learn from mistakes and all that.

So what successful software has he developed? 
So how does this guy measure what constitutes a â€œSuccessful Projectâ€?
[deleted]
Even having the leader as a dev doesn't always work. At one place I worked, we had developed a new insurance sales app with hugely complex rules engine for prices, front end full of conditions for what to show when, and a pretty complex financial back end component to shuffle money around between bank accounts, produce statements, reconcile payments etc. 

After 2 days testing it came down from above that we were to put it live and turn off the existing site. My boss went to the board to tell them that was a terrible idea and was unbelievably risky. He was told to do it or he would be fired. 

The results were spectacularly predictable. 
This cuts both ways. In my agency days I worked with more than one large company that simply needed an outside vendor to be the fall guy in order to protect the project owner's internal fiefdom within the company. The bigger the corporation, the more likely this is what was happening. It was truly bizarre. I saw huge brands, household names, go through multiple vendors like this.
The usual measurement is on time and on budget.
Any juicy details on the aftermath? In these circumstances it seems like the offending parties never get reprimanded and therefore never learn.
Nothing about how well the software fulfillâ€™s the clientsâ€™ needs?
No, the usual measure is if it was profitable.

Something can be on time, on budget, fulfill 100% of the requirements, be easy to use and still lose tons of money and provide no benefit to mankind.
It was pretty terrible. We basically fought fires for about 2 years as bugs and more fundamental issues with incorrect requirements that should have been picked up in testing made themselves known. A system like that would typically be in testing for months, including a period of time when it is run in parallel to the existing system to ensure the results are what is expected.

Of course, we were always the scape goat for any problem the business faced after that. The business in general had a really bad culture where the manager's main concern whenever they did anything was to ensure they had someone to blame should it go wrong. I swear those guys/ladies spend 90% of their time doing that. After maybe a year and a half, we had a project manager come on board who was excellent. He came in and cracked some skulls(sometimes ours, mostly the businesses though) and forced them to sort a lot of their shit out.

After about 2 years they wanted some really large changes. We ended up starting again from scratch. The code base was a mess from constantly applying emergency fixes where time was a much higher priority than quality. It was looking really good, but the company got bought out by its main rival when we were near completion. Good times.

So the whole thing was a clusterfuck from start to finish basically. Being an internal dev team for a company who have no idea about software development can be tough. They are used to jobs taking hours, or days for longer tasks. When we start talking about months they got very confused and put out. We also had comments about how so and so's 15 year old son can make a website in 2 hours, why is this taking so long. That's like asking someone at BMW why their car costs so much, when I can grab a piece of cardboard and slide down a hill for free. They just couldn't grasp that an insurance site was a different beast to a static page.

I also had a massive argument with the financial controller and senior accountants about rounding. We would take the money, split it typically three ways and round it to two decimal places since it is currency. None of them could understand why it wouldn't always add back up to the original total. It took multiple meetings of me smashing my head into a wall to get it through to them that if you round you lose precision, so you aren't always going to get back where you were. The thing that bewildered me, is when I asked them how they dealt with that when they processed the payments manually, none of them had any idea. Seriously.
you can serve webp images by using the browsers accept header - aka content negotiation. You can then serve webp to chrome (or blink based browsers) and jxr images to Edge. There is very little processing done there.    

Here is an [example using Nginx](https://corydowdy.com/blog/webp-jxr-nginx-content-negotiation-test)  
Have a look at the new picture element.
No support in Safari or Opera still
As of today, I think Safari is a lost cause as a browser. If it's supported in Chrome, it's only a short matter of time before it is in Opera.
I haven't looked into the picture element, but some [polyfill](https://github.com/scottjehl/picturefill) may or may not be sufficient.

Medium. com - where subjective opinions become articles.
There might be some worthwhile points in here but it's difficult to take seriously when it's written in the tone of an eight year old throwing a tantrum.

>Really all Iâ€™m saying is donâ€™t build a SPA

There isn't a cogent argument here that makes the case against single-page applications. The main argument seems to be "the users don't care", but there's no data provided to back up that claim. As a webuser myself I certainly do care at how seamless and natural a web application feels when I use it, and I'd make the counter-argument that SPAs can feel far more seamless and natural to users than constant in-browser round-tripping to the server and back.
> You see the Node.js philosophy is to take the worst fucking language ever designed and put it on the server.

I didn't know node.js was using malbolge.

Seriously, it seems that you concentrate too much on the bad parts and readily overlook the good parts of JavaScript.

You know, 2015 was actually the year when the cross-browser support of the most frequently used browsers stopped to suck, so developers used their pent-up energy to build the most overly complicated toolchains I ever had the misfortune to lay my eyes upon.

> JavaScript has no standard libraries

So what? Every decent developer usually collects some bookmarks to usable modules for everyday usage after a maximum of a month.

The main 2 reasons not to use JS on the server is a) because you're already using another language and don't want to port all your stuff or b) you like language XY better - but that's not the fault of JS, it's your choice.
This guy does realize that he doesn't have to use ANY of these tools, right?

If he thinks building web apps in nothing but jQuery and PHP(or any other stack,) is better than whatever new hotness is going around he is free to think for himself and pick what he believes to be the appropriate tools for the job at hand. We call this being a competent engineer!
I tend to agree with some of the author's sentiment though I'm sure some are turned off by the tone. The churn is crazy at work 
This article should basically be called "I'm not smart enough to do my job and it's everyone else's fault"
25 years ago, ASM guys were saying the same about C and compilers. Why do we need compilers, when we have assemblers?
I sort of agree. Look at ghost, released more than 2 years ago. So behind of Wordpress. If node was all about making life easier and better for the developers, why can't they engineer something with more features than WP?


I agree with the general idea that a lot of javascript dependency management and task running tools are over engineered, but that point get swallowed up by the authors general stupidity pretty quickly.

>Oh Vimeo, you couldnâ€™t display the view count on the video without bringing in React? I really appreciate that. My cpu does too.

This makes no sense. React's virtual DOM diffing would reduce paint cycles therefore it would reduce load on your CPU.

I think this author is one of those jquery copy pasters who is just mad he couldn't keep up any more.
And he just stole [my reddit comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/40ef75/no_i_dont_want_to_configure_your_app/cytpcwl)!
The biggest irony is that he is using Medium: One of the best continuous delivery-practicing web platforms out there.
> There might be some worthwhile points in here but it's difficult to take seriously when it's written in the tone of an eight year old throwing a tantrum.

I had the same reaction, I thought a few of the points were certainly worthwhile and on target.  The tone of the article, however, completely detracts from these otherwise valid points (valid at least from the standpoint of being worthwhile for the sake of discussion).
> So what? Every decent developer usually collects some bookmarks to usable modules for everyday usage

I think that sort of misses the point.  While I'm not necessarily condoning the general tone of the article, I do think this is a very good point.

There is a huge difference between developers individually squirreling away code snippets (or even sharing them) and something like a mature set of standard libraries.
To his credit, he does state that in the first paragraph.
Sure, but I think the point is that you can get lost in all the noise. If everyone's talking about the new shiny things, it's hard to have a real conversation about development.
He is smart enough to see our modern stacks are bullshit.
> why can't they engineer something with more features than WP?

Because Wordpress is infinitely more popular and has been around for over a decade where as Ghost hasn't even been around for half of one.
You can get a lot done in 13 years
I don't mean "squirreling away code snippets", but choosing a set of libraries and tools for everyday usage. Sooner or later, most of them will choose similarly - those libraries become de-facto standards (like jQuery in the frontend, for example).

Also, the maturity of a set of standard libraries requires time. Rome wasn't build in a day, neither was libstdc or pythons batteries.
I disagree. This is just a huge tirade about how web development isn't done with only the specific technology he likes using.
Ok but wordpress dominated the blog market in less than 2 years. Ghost is already near 3 years. Even worse, with PHP7 being released and showing huge improvements in performance, I really don't see much future there.
You can also do a lot when the blueprint is already done and you just have to mimic/improve it with a "supposedly/arguably" much more powerful language and tools.

Wordpress dominated the blog platform in less than 2 years. Ghost is almost 3 years and it's still way behind.

What I noticed with the nodejs scene is the proliferation of "one trick pony" type of apps being packaged with hundreds of dependencies that are a nightmare to maintain.
> choosing a set of libraries and tools for everyday usage

Yes, but these tools are all from completely disparate sources and repositories and are subject to changes outside any centralized visibility or control, which I think was more to the point of the OP's article and one of the better points (despite the lousy tone).

The nature of this means that your applications are fragile and maintenance is painful.

> the maturity of a set of standard libraries requires time

Couldn't agree more, I think that's the risk that should be highlighted.  In the absence of that maturity, developers should just be aware of the risks of the fast-moving environment they're playing in.  If your application is large and/or intended to be long-lasting, you should probably be aware of the maintenance nightmare you may be creating for yourself by hitching your wagon to immature, fast-moving, and completely independent moving parts at the core of it.

Unlike the OP's article, however, I'm not condemning the use of these things (or the improvement of mature standardization that would take time to cultivate).  I'm just saying I feel like it was a somewhat valid point for discussion presented in a completely immature manner by the source article we're discussing.
It is a rant about using these tools when they make no sense. When literally all they do is make the site more complicated and slower. He even says that they have there place. It is honestly silly how literally every company thinks they need an SPA now. 

*spelling
Yeah, but when Wordpress came out it didn't have to compete with Wordpress. Why would developers start using Ghost when they already know Wordpress, and probably just as important, when their clients already know what Wordpress is.
The answer to your question is hosting... Every cheap shared hosting account runs php... node is more difficult to host.. but it has its own set of benefits, mainly it can handle a much higher traffic load, it also does a much better job with websockets.

No one said node was a "much more powerful language". Different tools have different benefits. Blogging platforms are not the measure of a language.


With that same argument... how come you aren't out cloning yourself? You got a blueprint... go mimic and improve yourself. Maybe take the arrogance out of yourself this time? Should be easy right?

Shit doesn't work that way. Why don't you go build Reddit with a better feature set? Should take you a couple weeks eh? The site is right here for you to go through and mimic and type your magical code away.

Its not about what you see on the surface. Things take time, thought processing, trial and error. Wordpress is an old fucking man at this point, it dominated so quickly when it came out because it was the best tool out there at the time and because PHP was widely available on most hosts at the time.

You've got a lot to learn about how things work. When you get some real world experience, come back and re-read your comment about how easy it should be to develop a Wordpress-like platform.
> If your application is large and/or intended to be long-lasting

Wrong metric IMO. The application must require a big and changing set of external sources to be at risk. But yes, I get your point. Node.js is cool, but what it now needs is to exchange a bit of coolness for a lot of maturity.
I think anything that had a heavy amount of user interaction can benefit from it. Yeah, people's blogs don't need to be, but it does provide a better user experience in a lot of cases.

Im sure there are people out there abusing frameworks and libraries but that doesn't invalidate them. React really couldn't be simpler to learn and use. Used properly these libraries do not make sites slower (yeah if you include 30 of them in different files it will). But as big as they can be it's still like the size of two images.

In addition everything he mentions is completely optional. It's just a thoroughly ignorant article.
>  and probably just as important, when their clients already know what Wordpress is.

If it was much faster than wordpress, that would be a huge incentive to change since faster means better search engine rankings (SEO) which means more sales and money. This fact alone would attract both developers and clients but why it didn't happen?
> Node.js is cool, but what it now needs is to exchange a bit of coolness for a lot of maturity.

Thank you, that's a much more concise summary of my point.  Couldn't agree more!
> Yeah, people's blogs don't need to be, but it does provide a better user experience in a lot of cases.

So why does Ghost exist?
Clients who want something like what Wordpress want, want Wordpress. That is what everyone else uses and it's popular. Developers still use Wordpress because that is what the clients want.

Changing up a successful business strategy (developing for Wordpress) is not a very safe strategy.
So we are in agreement. Cheers!
>So why does Ghost exist?

Beacuse someone wanted to build it? Can you please elaborate on what point you'r trying to make here? 
Not sure that will work... Google Tag Manager uses JavaScript to add the markup to the page.  If Google supported this, then pages where users can run JavaScript could do malicious things, so I would expect them to ignore it.

There's a few ways to skin this cat though (article with more detail [here](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/189077?hl=en)):

- Add the markup to your sitemap
- Add the markup to your http headers
- Add the markup to the <head> of each page

You may only be familiar with the last one... #1 and #2 aren't too bad to implement either, but you will probably need a dev to get involved.
No, both only support MySQL and compatible forks like MariaDB / Percona.
What would be the best mssql compatible alternatives? 
I don't know, never worked with MS SQL, but I would look out for some .NET based solution, since they usually support MS databases.

I use 000Webhost for my portfolio and it's free. It's ad free and comes with PHP/mysql but that's about it. 
If you're hosting a portfolio of static content, you can do that just on [github pages](https://pages.github.com/) for free.
- Salt Lake City
- Just phpMyAdmin, SQL, etc
- Not much, maybe 20GB
$34 for all that per year is a pretty good deal mate
Agree, because no one is providing less than $34 price per year for hosting which [namecheap](https://www.cheapsslcouponcode.com/store/namecheap.com) is offering. And it is offering only $7.90 for the first year.
Good start! Even though the JS is in a very simple state, I do have some suggestions though. Have `randomQuote` return a quote rather than directly interact with the DOM. This separation will only help later on. Also, every time `randomQuote()` is called, the array of quotes is created every time which is a little wasteful. This is good opportunity to learn about caching and closures by using an IFFE:

    var randomQuote = (function() {
        var quotes = ['...', '...'];
    
        //...
    
        return function() {
            return quotes[randomNumber]);
        };
    }());


Perhaps change the pointer on button hover:

    .button:hover {
        cursor: pointer;
    }

I like the randomly generated background colours.
Good job there mate, liking your work. Keep on playing!
Nice
Great! I know nothing of caching and closures, so I'll look into that.
Good idea, I'll do that
Thanks! :)
I think [dokku](https://github.com/dokku/dokku) might be something that fits your need.
So a self-hosted PAAS. Depending on the complexity you can handle.

* https://www.openshift.org/
* www.openstack.org with terraform and deis ( https://deis.com/blog/2016/paas-continuous-integration-deployment ) 

Both of these are pretty enterprisey options and you will always need someone to manage the PAAS system itself.
Wow this looks exactly like what I needed, thanks!! 
We've got a pretty huge IT department and they are usually very bored and are trying to learn programming languages and stuff, so maybe they'll like these 'little' toys :)
By the sounds of it you will probably want to take a look at: Bootstrap, Angular and jQuery

I would generally use divs for the layout. But you can also use spans if you don't want to specify `display: inline-block` or use descriptive tags like `<nav>`.
> sorry for the terribly formatted code, still trying to suss out the formatting.... :/

Start your code with four spaces to make it format as code. RES makes that easy (select your code and press the angled brackets icon). Also, use something like codepen or jsfiddle, then you won't have to post it here and it makes it easier for us to test your code and mess around with it.

> This didn't work, I guess as divs are blocks. Since then I've been messing around trying them as spans, inline block spans

Any element's display value can be changed with css. You shouldn't  change a div to a span just because you want elements to be next to each other. Most html elements have a semantic meaning, and you should use those. Specifically, div is used for generic containers, not span. You can set `.my-div { display: inline-block; }` if you don't want it to be a block level element.

It's finally coming together!  Still a work in progress but [here it is](http://codepen.io/anon/pen/PZjmJZ).  Thanks very much to Mr_d_williams and larivact!

It's been a learning experience even putting this together, and got a lot more familiar with dev tools in the process!

e: managed to keep the code much neater this time, but if anyone has feedback I would be very happy to hear it.
This is great, thank you!  I was happy to specify inline-block, the problem was more my knowledge of how to position them correctly in relation to each other.  There is a lot of unfamiliar code in there to chew through but it looks great so I will get on with working out what it all does.  I did originally use <nav> but I'm not sure on the correct use of it so was only containing the 'About' and 'Blog' links inside it.

Thanks a lot!

e: Also, seeing the layout I had in mind actually implemented has also given me some confidence in how I was hoping it would turn out.
Sorry, I don't know what RES is.  I will bear in mind codepen and jsfiddle in future, haven't come across codepen before.

I thought div was most appropriate, was just having trouble getting the elements in the correct spaces even using inline blocks.  When I changed them to span, I changed them entirely from divs to spans rather than styling divs as spans.  I need to learn the semantic meanings better...

Thanks very much.
Exactly like that, layout-wise.  The issue with this is that I want to specify a fixed (maximum) size for the page title and have just the navbar to the right scale to fit the window, rather than both scaled to a specific percentage.  I know it looks blocky, but the page title in that box is basically going to be the over-arching theme for the site, and the most important thing for me is that it will render properly however people view it.

So, for example, I currently have the title set to 400px square and I managed to put the nav links at the top and 400px from the left.  The issue with this is that if the title scales smaller, the nav links will still appear 400px from the left rather than stuck to the right side of the title.

This is a much simpler approach than larivact's, above, thanks.  It never crossed my mind to do the nav links or the social buttons as lists, I assume images work fine in lists?  It doesn't scale as predictably though, so I may start with some elements from your implementation and then write in more complex stuff from larivact's as I get my head around it.

Generally div = layout, span = some subtext inside of other text. I.e `<h1>Hello! This is some <span class="red"> red </span> text.</h1>`

Thanks for the feedback. I'm aware of the issues applying formatting to all links but for the time being I only plan on having any in the header. You are right though, I need to fix it now before it becomes an issue later. 

Ultimately this is going to be my personal website, like an online CV. First goal is to get that header looking nice and scaling properly across devices as this is going to be a splash page with links to social media and an image or design in the empty space. 

Next up is to add a blog, probably WordPress for the sake of simplicity before trying to build something more cohesive with the splash page. Finally an about, which will be similar to the splash page. Maybe with the title scaled a little smaller, will see how it works out. 

This whole thing is meant to be an on going project that I can update and improve continuously as I learn. I guess that makes it all the more important to keep the code clean!
Thanks for clarifying.  This was my understanding, I was just struggling to get the divs behaving.

I completed a ton of mega-basic stuff online like codecademy HTML, CSS, some of the htmldog stuff but this is my first project and I just couldn't get it to come together after a good chunk of a day messing with it and googling what I could think of (you don't know what you don't know...).
Yeah, I had it looking relatively neat in my head and on my first attempt.  It looks a lot messier after all the things I tried, even after I attempted to take the failed code back out.  That is an issue I need to fix.  The CSS was properly tabbed in my text editor, I'm not sure how I broke the code formatting in my original post.

This is my first non-hand-holding project and all the individual parts are ok, it was just bringing it together in a specific way that was causing issues for me.

That's good to know, thank you.  I haven't really looked into Wordpress in great detail yet as I haven't yet got hosting sorted out so it'd probably be a free account to start.  I have a friend who does Wordpress development which hopefully means I can get a point in the right direction when I start that.
This is what I'd originally attempted to do, but I ended up messing with the HTML a ton after I started to struggle with the CSS.  Thanks again!
[deleted]
Right.  I will look into hosting sooner rather than later then!
Is it worthwhile looking into using Jekyll and hosting on Github as a way to get started with a blog for free?  Or better to jump in with Wordpress and sort out hosting properly?
[deleted]
A friend just recommended digital ocean to me as well, I will be looking into it.  Github is only static pages, but Jekyll is some kind of blog framework that applies a theme to markdown for posts, and it works with Github but only as static pages.  It looks limited though.

I may host my splash page only on Github as a stopgap while I mess around with setting up servers locally and find a proper host to get the blog running.  Thanks for your replies and the stuff you've linked, it has helped a lot.
The right side.
320px
I usually set a min-width to be 320px on the body. Even if you have a smaller screen you can still scroll horizontally and vertically. I know this isn't really optimising but you can't fit much under 320px.
320px
320px
320px -- but I've not really caught up on smart watches. I assume there's web browsers on them -- especially the Android ones but not iOS. If you sort this list by **width x height dp** you can see how small they get:

What's your use case? 
Buy the book [Smart and Gets things Done](http://www.amazon.com/Smart-Gets-Things-Done-Technical/dp/1590598385). It's a really good read with some solid advice. The title says it all, you want someone is smart, but also pragmatic enough to get things done. A smart person who re-invents the wheel with every project or switches frameworks regularly is probably going to end up being trouble.

I interview a lot and here's a few things I've learned:

* Always ask the same technical questions. If you vary the questions it's hard to get a good gauge of who did better, especially in situations where you like several candidates for one role.

* Ask an easy technical question, like stupidly easy that anyone can get "what is a div?", "what javascript native function gets a reference to an element?". The point here is not to test technical knowledge but to test personality. If a person gets upset and says "I know what I'm doing, this is easy, why are you asking me stupid questions?" that reeks of unprofessionalism. In my mind that person lacks social skills and will have difficult working in a team. Especially cross functional teams where not every person is a web developer or even developer period.

* Ask medium/hard questions. These are what you use to assess the technical chops of a candidate. Ask real world questions relating to the technology and make people white board it. Also be lenient on syntax errors, people get freaked out and may get a few thigns wrong. It's more important to see if they understand concepts. For example, we were interviewing for an angular role and someone used ng-visible instead of ng-show. He used it correctly, but probably just got nervous so I let it slide.

* Ask really hard algorithm questions. Like the easy question, the point here is not the answer. I couldn't care less. The point is to see how the candidate reacts under pressure. Do they throw a fit and start saying "it's unfair" ( I had a guy do this)? Do they quit without trying and say "no I'm not gonna try"? Or do they have a conversation with you, mention that they haven't had to do something like this but will try and talk out the answer with you? This is the best result, but I love this type of question because I want to know how the person will react under stress. We don't have a lot of stress, but as any development job, it might come up.


As for format, he's what I recommend:

* Start with an introduction on your team and self. Briefly mention what you do.

* Ask the candidate to talk about their experience. Watch what they say, are they speaking all technical terms? Are they discussing recent projects from a high level. This will tell you a lot about how they thing. Also ask questions about what they talked about. Do they answer or ignore you? I had a guy who would not let me get a word in edgewise. And when I did ask a question he would ignore it and just say "you gotta hear this!"

* Technical questions on a whiteboard. If the room doesn't have a whiteboard, get one :)

* Towards the end ask the candidate if they have any questions. Good candidates will ask about the job ,culture, expectations etc. Not asking anything is a red flag for me.

Sorry for the lengthy post, but I hope this helped.

Edit: Forgot to mention. For internal candidates, you have to be a bit more careful. Be honest and talk to your boss about what you think. If the person can't cut it, you have a responsibility to say it now rather than live with the consequences later.  If you pass an internal candidate and go with someone else, don't feel bad and he/she asks about it just refer them to your manager.
Let them talk. Some interviewers love to talk but you are trying to interview the candidate not tell them your life story.

Make sure you know what you are looking for, don't try to sell the job as being an amazing new project then 99% is bug fixing a 10 year old code base. Don't claim you are cutting edge if you still need to support IE6. 

Be prepared. Have the CV printed out and of course fully read BEFORE the interview. Have a room free. Have clean cups. If you don't know how to make coffee, have someone available who can. If you interview in the lunch room, clean it up.
This is super helpful and pragmatic, thanks for offering these up. More interviewers could take note. 
Here we ask candidates to do a practical assignment before coming in, for front-end we send a PSD over and ask them to create it. There's no detailed requirements, this way we can see what technologies they choose to use, their coding styles and that they're up to the job.

If we have any questions or concerns about their work we bring them up when they come in for the interview, besides that it's more of an informal chat.
If they have a github profile, spend 10 minutes going through it and have them talk about what they did in one of their projects that uses the tech that best matches what you guys are using for the job you're hiring for (i.e., angular or react or jquery or core/vanilla JS/ES6 or whatever).

Inquire about why they did what they did,  what they learned from it, what they would do differently if they were to do it again, etc.

Be sure and leave them at least 10 minutes at the end for their questions as well.
Begin the interview with getting an idea of who the interviewee is and try to give the interviewee an idea of what you are looking for.  Then take a pause and explain that you want to get an idea of where they are in their skill set.  Take a couple general 5 minute things to work through together. Mostly you leading the first question and letting them fill in the blanks. This gives them time to adjust from talking about xyz to thinking about code. It also will give them a context for your questions as you move through the interview. Anyways work through a couple together as a team and then let them take the lead on a couple questions. 

Every interview I've had so far it's like "hows your family"...etc, then immediately into a coding question. My brain needs a second to switch gears.
Ask them to invert a tree.
Thank you for such a detailed post. This is some really really solid advice. I'll get that book ordered and give it a read. 

> thigns

I hope this was a deliberate mistake :)

Great points, especially the legacy code and browser support. I'd prefer to be honest to candidates rather than fake it to win them over.
Also, always be selling the position. This is a competitive hiring environment and if you conduct the interview badly you can succeed in finding the perfect candidate only to have them decide that your company isn't a good option. 

To that end, spend at least 10% time, probably more, talking about how great it is to work where you are. If you don't mind being slightly cruel, do this even more with clearly bad candidates, as bad candidates may know good candidates, and if they're really bad you probably don't have a lot of other things to spend the interview time on. Try to integrate this period into the "Do you have any questions about Company X?" window of the interview, don't just awkwardly go into selling mode. Also, don't focus on money, if possible, other than to honestly say the pay is "competitive". Let HR deal with the $$$ stuff, unless that's your bag at a very small shop. If the only good reason to work at your company is money, it's probably not really a very good place to work in the grand scheme, and good candidates will recognize this.
No need to use jquery; you can easily use plain javascript for this. [Here's an example](https://jsfiddle.net/cjmoran/ofxax5q5/).
Remember to test the site out on mobile if people visit the site on their phones ... cuz onhover (and similar functions) can do some crazy shit on mobile 
Cheers thank, just to confirm , i can hover over ANOTHER div and the intended image iwll change wont it? This example just overlayed itself
Im not intending to go hard out on mobile support (maybe I should) whats an alternative for that mechanic but on mobile?
It's not a complete example for your case by any means; you'll have to adapt it to fit what you're doing, but I think you can figure it out.
You should, just check and make sure it looks ok on mobile is all he is saying. If not use media queries to make adjustments.
Cool will do
I think he is also referring to using hover on a mobile device. Now how are you exactly going to hover over the image on a touch screen?
Clicks it is then!

Oh for sure, good call.
On several devices (such as my old iPhone 4s), pressing down once on elements with onhover would result in the execution of the onhover effect until something else gets pressed.  
Thanks Apple.
Or both ;p
import.io is my go to.  It comes across as being aimed at non devs people but their development team is pretty solid and using their tool with a little Xpath thrown in and then accessing websites as an API is very nice.  The sheer volume they allow me to scrape for free is ridiculous.
If you want to do it yourself, I usually go with fetch and cheerio in node
Maybe this will do the trick?
https://www.npmjs.com/package/sitescraper Not  a cloud service though. And now Kimono is going away for real: http://blog.kimonolabs.com/2016/02/15/the-kimono-team-is-joining-palantir/
And ScrapingHub seems to have gotten a lot better. Not as cheap as import.io though, but a lot of nice features.

http://scrapinghub.com/
 I like import, but I find that if I'm scraping page 2/3/4 of 20, for some reason it always gives me the results of page 1. Even if I'm on the right page. Kimono never seems to have that glitch

Looks like Kimono is back up! 
It's not a glitch, if you don't send the correct parameters in the request it will return the default page.  There is something wrong with your request.
>Changed that ID from a string to a Number? No problem. Right click, refactor, done.

Really contrived example. Also `right click->refactor`?

>Add a method that all models should have? No problem, the interface will tell you which ones break.

This is solved by inheritance.

>No problem, the interface will tell you which ones break.

This is what tests are for.

I really don't understand why Typescript exists. Type checking itself is a code smell. Any insights?
> `Really contrived example. Also `right click->refactor?`

 Maybe you're a VIM person and would prefer to grep with a regular expression and write a macro, but any modern IDE will just let you right click on a property and change its signature/name globally in a context-aware way. Contrived? I'd hardly think I'm creating an unrealistic example, this is literally the most basic of examples I can think of. I was trying to give a simple case. A contrived example would be, "say you made a class definition and wanted to change a property X to a getter/setter"

> This is solved by inheritance.

| No problem, the interface will tell you which ones break.

I was simply stating the case where you have classless definitions, in the case of simple objects, data transfer objects/VM whatever you want to call them. You normally wouldn't want to extend things like this unless you want really convoluted code.

> This is what tests are for.

Why not catch them before even writing a test? Your tests should focus on correct business logic, why waste your time asserting type at this (late) juncture?

> Type checking itself is a code smell. Any insights?

Most coming from other OOP languages would argue the exact opposite: that the js lack of types is itself the smelliest thing. Implicit type conversion is probably the #1 hated thing about js.
| Type checking itself is a code smell

I've been laughing for days at the thought of this. I quoted this to all my coworkers at three different companies and they all LOL'd. =)
Ignorance is bliss I suppose.
Nice article. Formatting on mobile is kind of off though. What text editor is that in the screenshots? It looks great!
I don't mean to patronise you - but are you sure that MongoDB is the right database for your application? Consider that "normal" SQL engines like Postgres are almost always the better choice for relational data.

Unfortunately, I'm not well aware of the Play Framework at this point - so I'm not much help on that front.
For strong typed languages, I would indeed recommend SQL-based databases. It has been around longer and there are more tools to make them work together.

On the other side of the spectrum, NodeJS works better with MongoDB, because you don't have to translate everything to JSON.
Not patronizing at all.  And no, i'm not entirely sure. I am more familiar with Postgres, but the schema for this application might change several times, so I figured a document database might be more suited for this sort of thing. Plus the idea of automatic sharding (if it becomes necessary) is very attractive. Any advice is welcome though!

Edit: would I be better off learning to use the noSql features of Postgres?
I'm sorry, but I can't really condone that argument.

First off, MongoDB is a document store database - and SQL databases are typically relational. They're for different things. The language under which they're used does not make a single bit of difference to the fact that they are designed for completely different purposes.

Furthermore, you can get Node ORMs that deal with relational databases (providing a Mongo-like interface in the process) and spit out JSON. See Sequelize. If you don't want to use an ORM, then converting your resultset to JSON is less than five lines of work. Barely a hassle compared to what you'll likely end up dealing with if you use MongoDB and similar databases for purposes they were not designed for.

Sorry if that came off as aggressive - but you can't say that all NodeJS applications work better with MongoDB - because that's not the whole picture and people blindly following that advice can get themselves in deep shit easily.
> Edit: would I be better off learning to use the noSql features of Postgres?

If you're already knowledgeable with Postgres, no reason not to at least research it's NoSQL features. 
I am aware of Node ORM's, but all I was saying was that the extra translation from 2D columns and rows to 3D objects costs a lot of time. MongoDB isn't ideal for every single situation and other databases have other advantages, but from my personal experience, I find that MongoDB in combination with Mongoose works perfectly for the kinds of things I am doing.
Ok. If I did end up deciding to use a document database, would Postgres still give me the same benefits (horizontal scaling) Mongo does? 
There are numerous sharding plugins for Postgres, and this is true of most relational databases. People often underestimate how much stress databases can take as a single instance though. 
Ok cool. I guess that gives me something to start with!
Many domain registrars allow you to make a DNS entry that just does a URL Redirect for you. If you don't have that option, you could use a `.htaccess` file on your website and add a redirect entry like (requires mod_alias which is likely included):

    Redirect / http://www.othersite.com

You can also make that `Redirect 301 ....` to make a "moved permanently", `302` for "moved temporarily" (default) or `303` for "see other".

If you want to be a little more advanced and you have mod_rewrite, you can redirect based on a pattern or condition:

    RewriteEngine On

    RewriteCond %{REQUESTED_FILENAME} !-f
    RewriteRule (.*) http://www.othersite.com [R=301]

That will only redirect if the requested file is not found. 

If you don't have apache (or can't use `.htaccess` files) and do have PHP, then a simple script like this would work in an index file:

    <?php
    header("Location: http://www.othersite.com");

Choose one. They all work. For something as simple as the example site, they probably just use the first one and redirect every request regardless of where the request is to.
Domain forwarding or use a htaaccess file and simply redirect.
You could set up a script to redirect to the website you wanted like this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/768431/how-to-make-a-redirect-in-php (sorry for the link, I'm on mobile)
If you are too lazy/don't have access to DNS/domain control, you can just make an index.html file with the following:

      <html>
        <head>
          <title>Title</title>
          <META http-equiv="refresh" content="0;URL=http://www.google.com">
        </head>
        <body>
        </body>
      </html>

Just replace google with where you want your visitors to go.

It does my heart good to see somebody remembering to mention the correct status codes.
Thank you! You're awesome.
Right? I thought everyone would take this as the low hanging fruit question and talk about the Javascript location.window redirect, but someone put in the work for the good answer, we're good here. 
What's wrong with js other than if someone has js disabled? Just browsing, not arguing or anything 
Ah, thanks for asking! 

Yes, you run the risk of someone having js disabled which would render your entire redirect attempt futile, but so much more goes on behind the scenes. 

For one, as someone mentioned, you don't get the proper redirect code up, and that can have an impact on your SEO. 

Next, you're waiting until the absolute last moment to redirect them, which means two things:

You're going to possibly get a screen flash if you start loading other html and even css content before your Javascript redirect. This is depending on if you load it at the top of the page, or in some third party plugin that puts it a  the bottom inside a jQuery on window. ready function that waits for the DOM to load and then some.

Next, even if it was the absolute first thing you put on your page (at the top of your head) you're still going through a lot of unnecessary steps which slow down the redirect for the client, and needlessly increases your machine's computes. You could put it a step before at the header level, or even remove the need to send that resources, if I'm not mistaken, by going to the .htaccess* level (depending on what server you use - apache*), you can even go higher up than that in the server to have it be one of the first things, computationally, that would activate the redirect.  There can be multiple levels of mod_alias's .htaccess and the higher up you go in the root, the sooner that script is activated, and the better.

This is a non-exhaustice look into that, but I'm sure others here could share more knowledge on the subject, adding to this and enlightening us as to how this would be best done on nginx, Microsoft, and other popular web servers. 
All this, plus you break the user's back button!
Hahaha, correct! I knew there was more! 
No, it doesn't mean that at all. Read it. Read the license. Compared to most lawyerspeak, it's in pretty natural English. The GPL defines what you can do with the *source* code, not your business model.
https://popmotion.io/pricing

The GPLv3 license is â€œstickyâ€, so software incorporating Popmotion must also be released under GPLv3.

say my site is dashboard for freelancers or something, wont that need to be GPLv3 also
No. No. No.

If your application code uses a GPL licensed library, *when you distribute* your application, it must be available in pure source. That means if you give people your web application- not let them interact with their browser, I mean actually give them the application itself so that they could host it on their own servers- then you must include the source code.

If you don't distribute your application- if you only host it on your own servers, for example, or you only give the code to internal users (within your own company), then the GPL's viral clause kicks in.

It is not *sticky* it is *viral*. It guarantees that every distribution of code that leverages GPL code in any way is *itself* GPLed. Hosting a web application is not considered "distribution".
From the FSF:

> A company is running a modified version of a GPL'ed program on a web site. Does the GPL say they must release their modified sources? (#UnreleasedMods)
> The GPL permits anyone to make a modified version and use it without ever distributing it to others. What this company is doing is a special case of that. Therefore, the company does not have to release the modified sources.

> It is essential for people to have the freedom to make modifications and use them privately, without ever publishing those modifications. However, putting the program on a server machine for the public to talk to is hardly â€œprivateâ€ use, so it would be legitimate to require release of the source code in that special case. Developers who wish to address this might want to use the GNU Affero GPL for programs designed for network server use.

Note, the Affero GPL is not the GPLv3 license. Again, read the actual GPL to understand what it does and does not allow.

I really wish that I could connect with more people here [okc] who were genuinely as interested in the field as I am. 
Sure, 1 question: Why? Services like this already exist and have for some time, unless I'm interpreting this incorrectly. 
I have an idea for something I plan on using for for board games with friends.

And if these services exist can you give me an example of some?
Ohh. I misunderstood. 
Wish I could help, but I don't think anyone has done it up as well as /u/JeffreyWay

Edit: turns out that username is not a thing. Really thought it was. 

Edit 2: Being smarte
The closest I've found in terms of quality for the JS world are the videos over at egghead.io -- although they are a little short in pure Node courses. They have some solid front-end framework courses though.

Laracasts are really awesome and I hope someone as good as JW can fill that void for JS.
I've heard good things about http://nodeschool.io/
Not free, but https://egghead.io is awesome, I'm pretty sure they have node tutorials, along with a lot of other JS stuff.
egghead.io and codeschool aren't bad places to look. Codeschool is probably better if you don't have much node experience. 
There's nothing for any language on the same level as laracasts to be honest. Pluralsight has some good node stuff though, and they have al lot of it plus a lot of other topics.

https://egghead.io is good, also http://scotch.io has some good stuff too.

We use Node as our primary development tool, mainly for building APIs though. If you set it up correctly, the performance differences can be massive over PHP... But remember it's not a solution to everything.
It is, you just spelled his name wrong - /u/Jeffreyway
The demand is there, somebody needs to step up :P
could not agree more. Laracasts is amazing
I'll definitely check this out. Thanks!
Could you give me a scenario where node would not be a suitable back-end. I agree with you but am just curious
So just dumb then :)

I think about something I want to do, and iterate on it a lot. Most of the time, the idea I started out wanting to do ends up totally different.
What do you mean by "semantic HTML"? Like using `<nav>` for your navigation section? Or not having deeply nested `<div>`s for purely style reasons? Or something more specific, like RDFa?

We use the "semantic" HTML5 elements all the time, and we avoid style-only `<div>`s. As long as you're targeting modern browsers and take the time to learn modern CSS it isn't very hard. It certainly simplifies things.
Semantics is a core concept of HTML.  The point of it is for every element to have a meaning that can be easily interpreted by machines.

The trouble is, semantics is a hard concept to grasp, especially when it's easy to never delve deeper than the obvious visual context.  Proper semantics also requires discipline.

It didn't help matters that HTML5 completely fucked up semantics at almost every opportunity: undeprecating and redefining old presentational elements, nonsensical and contradictory sectioning, and promoting sloppy practices.
It's as important as it was back in the day. Lots of developers just don't care. They don't know why it's important or they just don't care.
A lot of people have referenced semantic HTML as being important for accessibility, but I find that kind of unhelpful without examples. A really great example is the HTML5 `main` element.

The `main` element was created in response to the extremely common practice of creating a `<div id="main">` (or `id="mainContent"`, etc.) to house the actual content of our pages. All screen readers use keyboard shortcuts so that users can quickly get to where they want to go, and JAWS (one of the most popular screen readers) actually has one key dedicated specifically to the `main` element (others put it inside [landmark](http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/roles#landmark_roles) menus). When a JAWS user loads a page with a `main` element, they can move directly to it and start reading by pressing Q. If they load the same page with `<div id="main">`, the quickest way to get to it is likely arrowing through block-level elements until they happen to find it. And since most modern webpages have tons of stuff in the DOM that comes before the main content, this can take a while.

It would be like loading a page where nothing is styled visually (not even by the user agent), and trying to find the article. Sure you can do it, but good god is that an awful user experience.

I should also point out that search engines use semantic tags to understand webpages in much the same way assistive technology uses them. My guess is the good search engines also use common usage patterns such as `<div id='main">`, but semantic HTML represents a higher degree of certainty for what the content is.

A great example of this is HTML5's `track` element for `video` captions/subtitles: search engines know to find the transcript of a video that has `<track kind="captions" src="dQw4w9WgXcQ-Captions.vtt" srclang="en">` inside the dQw4w9WgXcQ-Captions.vtt file, and can do a lot better job of serving up your video when someone searches a string of text from it as a result. Put your captions/subtitles source in your JS or a dummy `span`/`div` (or don't caption them!), and SEO becomes much more laborious for you.
Pretty important if you're disabled and using a screen reader to access the web.
If you care about accessibility it is very important.
Semantic markup is absolutely not a fad. It is, in fact, an incredibly important part of building a website. It is your job as a web developer to always write semantic code, along with readable/organized naming conventions. 
A big reason for this is future-proofing your website. Browsers currently don't make decisions based on your html tags, but in the future they probably will. 
Another reason is so that your code is easier to maintain, read, and expand on in the future.
Accessibility also benefits from semantic markup. (Although there are many other steps that must be taken for true accessibility).
The most important reason to always write semantic html, however, is this:
Form follows function. 
You must have an understanding of what type of content comprises your website BEFORE making decisions about how it will look.

Screen readers and other assistive tech rely on semantic, valid structure to make sense of the code. By not doing so you basically discriminate against some users by making your code inaccessible and unusable.
I agree that there doesn't seem to have been a huge uptake of this, I feel like the HTML5 spec and surrounding documentation doesn't do a great job of explaining *why* we should be using the new elements. Add to that the fact that WAI-ARIA also does a very similar thing and was released at a similar time, and you're left with confused developers.

Basically, if you want to add a button to your website, use the <button> element, not a <div> that has been styled and given JavaScript to behave like a button. A lot of this is common sense, but it's really essential for people using screen readers and sometimes even just using the keyboard. 

Also, for those concerned abut still having to support older browsers etc, you're good if you're supporting IE8+. It may feel like a shiny new technology but there is decent support for it. 
The semantic web idea comes from the Knowledge Representation and Reasoning research field. The goal is to be able to represent and then extract "knowledge" from that representation.
It is much more ambitious than just using navs and time tags instead of divs and spans. The reason there's navs/section/article etc tags is because they have a semantic meaning. A div has no inherent meaning (e.g. you have very clear expectations about how the nav tag is used, however not with a div).
I remember a time on the 90s and early 2000 where people believed that you'd be able to extract knowledge (that you could use computationally) automatically from web pages. I guess we already do this (natural language processing), but the idea at the time was that we'd have more formal methods to represent that knowledge, or even tools to help us do it in HTML.

If you want to know more about this, just look up Knowledge representation and reasoning, semantic web and ontologies.

For web developers, it is very easy to understand why we'd dismiss using nav instead of a div, and not bother with using footer, article, etc. We are disconnected from the reasons that lead to the creation of these tags.
I think less and less people are talking about it because most people are doing it (in my experience that is true). So there's no need to rant about using header/footer tags or tables for tabular data now.
Actually I think they are quite awesome. It not only improves the code's readability.. You can also do "irky" things like having for example a `<section>` element for each element in a typical list of content with it's own `<h1>` + having a `<h1>` for your page as usual without messing with big brother's indexing.
I think it's become somewhat common knowledge at this point that you don't see many posts about "semantic html" around. It's integrated into most reputable tutorials so it's not presented as a new thing anymore.

In my case, I use `div`s in my codepens when I'm too lazy, however I still try to later edit the proper elements into them to encourage their usage.

You don't ***have*** to use proper html tags in your website, but if you do it will be a great help Assisted Technology users, and there are also other perks.

Writing html with accessibility in mind can be a tad tiring, but then you're probably also not designing for just one browser in any case, so IMO it should definitely be part of your workflow.
They help a lot with my CSS. I barely use classes for small pages anymore.
It's not really something to get excited about, more of a best practice that quietly gets done. Doing something obviously non-semantic with tags will get flagged in a code review, but that's the extent of it.
Keep in mind: HTML is a *data format*. The purpose of HTML is to describe a tree-based data structure that can be converted into a DOM, and in conjunction with CSS rules, that DOM tree can be presented to a user.

Semantic HTML, then, is essentially adding typing to your data structure. A section of the document is literally called a `<section>`. The elements we use to mark up our data *also* describe that data.
I am actually required by law to do a certain minimum amount of semantic HTML, or to at least make an effort. I'm not sure how well I comply, however, as I'm not always in control over the HTML that gets created by the things I make. But I do my best to enable better semantic HTML than what was there before.
Semantic html really helps people with screen readers.
When making a website, I only use semantic html.  When making a web app, I try to make an effort, but ultimately, interactivity wins out.
I think you stopped hearing about it because it was pretty easily adopted as an important ideal once it was surfaced and made possible. Unlike more controversial stuff - like which CMS is the right one, or whether or not inline styles or Angular are the right ways to approach a project - everyone agrees using semantic HTML is important.


I'm not going to say every project I put out is perfect in this lense, but unless there is a good reason in a moment not to I will use the right container for the right content. And from what I randomly see viewing source in other people's work, they mostly do the same. I think the current exception is CMS themes for Drupal or Wordpress where they are trying to solve 8 layout problems with one set of containers. There, unless they have been very diligent, I think you lose some semantic stuff along the way to making the layout adaptive for the editor.
Wellâ€¦ eventually we'll have smart AI and it won't be necessary. But in the meantime, I expect it to remain. It's just kinda the standard way to do things now, so nobody is particularly excited about it any more.
Semantic html, like separation of concerns, not reinventing the wheel, keep it simple stupid, etc, are ideals to aspire to, not rigid rules.

I try to keep my html semantic whenever possible, but so far no non-trivial project has ever managed to be 100% semantic.
Semantic HTML was a fad.  People constantly bring up screen readers, but all the major screen readers work well with non-semantic sites.

At the end of the day semantic HTML doesn't solve any problems and just leads to silly developer circlejerks.
I think semantic HTML has evolved from what it used to be. People make the mistake of thinking it means only the standard semantic tags -- section, aside, nav, header, etc -- but in fact it doesn't really begin to shine until you add your own tags.

Yes you should use section, aside, nav, time, etc, because of the global semantics they carry on their own. But you should also use my-sidebar, my-secondary-nav, my-dropdown, my-loading-spinner, and the like. Not only is it much easier to read than `<div class="loading-spinner">`, it's a lot easier to target with low-specificity CSS (`my-loading-spinner` instead of `div.loading-spinner`), and having its own element name also makes it feel more important, encouraging CSS developers to treat it as a standalone "widget" rather than just an item to be styled in the context it began in.
It depends on what you mean by semantic. Back in the day that just meant using well named ID's and Classes. We didn't have all of these new fancy html5 tags. 


I think that we stopped talking about it about the time frameworks like bootstrap became popular. We assumed frameworks would take care of it. 


I think thats a poor assumption. Bootstrap does make things a lot better. But you still have to remain vigilant as developers to have semantic markup. And I think we are all guilty of dropping the ball every now and then.

So far only benefits using new html5 tags is for easier code reading? Thats ridiculous, specially if you need javascript fallback files to support older IE. Im no pro IE or anything and everything can be fixed with feat
ure detection but these new tags so far seem like candy to developers and nothing more. Adding aria roles of course changes the game.
My semantics issue is finding apprpiate class names. Red or pull-right is not semantic, list-item-title is
The sectioning algorithm makes sense to me. What's contradictory about it?
Web semantics is a way of thinking, this is a great read [How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love HTML](http://html5doctor.com/lets-talk-about-semantics/)

This is pretty much the answer. "Why use `<nav>` when we can simply use `<div>`? Why use `<time>` when we can just use `<span>`?" That's the kind of shit I hear.
I was actually wondering this the other day. I did a few website re-creations for practice, and looking at the source code was an eye opener. A lot of places were using <article> and <section> for blocks of their website, and using <header><footer>.

I started wondering why use those things when you can just <div> up your website into sections and comment each section. I still use <header><footer> but I don't use things like <article><section> for blocks of my website, I just create different div blocks and comment them as containers for specified content.

Should I use <section><article>? When is it appropriate?

> back in the day.

Also note that "back in the day" is really long ago - so it's definitely not a "passing fad".
[deleted]
HTML5's methodology relied too much on usage metrics and assumed that even the lowliest, laziest developer was doing things correctly (which everyone knows they don't).  Semantics to a large part became *argumentum ad populum*.  The result is that they canonized a ton of popular (but bad) practices into the standard itself.  All in an effort to make HTML "easier" by transforming it into whatever developers were already doing (wrongly).
Future proofing?? I'm wasting more than enough time on backward compatibility! Now I have to support browsers which don't exist yet?? Nooooooo
>discriminate 

That's a big word. Some would disagree with you.
Inconsideration isn't discrimination.
> I agree that there doesn't seem to have been a huge uptake of this, I feel like the HTML5 spec and surrounding documentation doesn't do a great job of explaining why we should be using the new elements.

I consult on accessibility as well, a good way to describe it is by showing them that <nav role="navigation"> is redundant and why.
For those interested:
http://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web

I'm guessing that one of the reasons it did not pick up any/much steam can be seen in the example on wikipedia:

The sentence *Paul Schuster was born in Dresden* becomes the following in order to allow a machine to understand it:

    <div vocab="http://schema.org/" typeof="Person">
      <span property="name">Paul Schuster</span> was born in
      <span property="birthPlace" typeof="Place" href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1731">
        <span property="name">Dresden</span>.
      </span>
    </div>

Most web devs and web based products probably don't need that, so they don't invest time into something that's just "nice to have". However as far as I know, IBM Watson does/did use some of the techniques/tools associated with semantic web - maybe AI will drive this field further in the future?
how does that work?
just so you know, you can add semantics to non semantic elements ... for instance <div role="navigation"> is the same as <nav> to a screen reader.
30% of screen reader users like navigating Web pages by using landmark regions.  

If you don't use semantic elements like <nav> that becomes impossible.  Also if you spoof a button by making it a click able div, that can potentially result in a lawsuit if you don't properly handle tab index and keyboard functionally as well.

Screen readers like JAWS, NVDA, and Chrome Vox will work on sites without semantic HTML but they might lose functionality the users become accustomed to.  If you want to build your product well, care about semantics. 
If you don't use html elements semantically and appropriately you end up with stuff like tables turned into buttons via javascript and other horrible things. If you use html semantically and appropriately you get something far more robust than you would otherwise, because browsers are built to web standards, and have sensible defaults for elements.

I always try to start with a semantic, robust core functionality personally.

You should absolutely not use your own made up tags, it's not even valid HTML to do so!

I think you completely missed the point of semantic HTML. Semantic HTML isn't about making it easier for the developers it's about making it easier for the users. Using your own made up tags will make absolutely no sense for screen-readers, search engine crawlers, browsers "read" mode, and other automated tools.

I'm pretty sure Google and other search engines will also punish you for having invalid tags.
In the case of something like `<my-loading-spinner>`, how do you cope with accessibility? What gives meaning to that element, beyond the visuals you apply with CSS? Are you using ARIA?
> It depends on what you mean by semantic. Back in the day that just meant using well named ID's and Classes. We didn't have all of these new fancy html5 tags.

Actually, that's why you weren't supposed to use tables for layout. Because tables were semantically intended for tabular data.
No, we don't. Its not 2005 anymore. We can use flexbox, inline-block, transforms,  ghost elements, or even display: table-cell (which is not the same as using a table) nowadays
The new elements effectively have built in roles, so instead of `<div role="navigation">`, you just have `<nav>`. 

But to really understand the benefits of the new elements, you have to wrap your head around [the HTML 5 document outline algorithm](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/08/html5-and-the-document-outlining-algorithm/).

Sadly most people don't seem to care enough to do that - because it doesn't in any way affect them. It's mostly people using assistive technologies that could benefit the most from it. *Edit:* It turns out they don't get any benefit from it either, yet.
It's pretty neat to see how a screen reader interprets html5 tags. If you or anyone ever has a chance to play around with JAWS or NVDA you may find a whole new perspective on using good semantics. There no test that compares to just closing my eyes and trying to experience my work without visual information available.
Not entirely relevant but IE 10 and below is not longer supported ... Am I the only one who adds an "upgrade your browser" message and doesn't care?
Those kinds of code monkeys also typically have other really bad habits.
Doesn't it help with analytics?
As far as how it renders on the screen, use whatever you want. If you want a search engine or piece of software to know where you placed your nav, I would use nav.
Yeah, you should use those semantic tags whenever possible. They're important for web accessibility. For example, if somebody is using a screen reader, the software may specifically look for article tags for content.

A lot in this sub don't seem to work in the real world
the Department of Justice, Americans with Disabilities Act Title 3, and Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act would disagree with them
Not really - it may not be intentional, but if there are two equal ways of doing something and you chose the one that disadvantages a group of people, you *have* discriminated against them whether it was intentional or not.
The main factor to be concerned about here is presenting information and resources to users with various forms of sensory input. Blind vs sighted users is the common example but the scope of disability is far wider.  If a disabled user can not access the site in all the ways other users could then they are being discriminated against. 

This is only recently becoming a serious concern here in the States but other countries ( ex Australia) are taking accessible sites much more seriously with litigation cases yielding heavy fines and committees/departments being created to regulate it.
Hmm. Debatable...
Whether or not it's inconsiderate is your own opinion, whether it's discrimination is a legal issue. For public/government sites in the US, it's discrimination.
I guess it'd be something like


h1 { /* style goes here * / }

section h1 { /* style goes here * / }
Effectively a `<section>` element (or a `aside`/ `article`/ `nav`) is a sub-section of document which can have it's own set of headings. Have a read of https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/08/html5-and-the-document-outlining-algorithm/
Not true. It is perfectly valid HTML5 (you should prefix your tags, like I did with 'my', but only to avoid future clashes) and is not at all penalised by search engines. I'm not saying you should pepper your system with once-off custom element names, but where it makes sense and when you are defining the root of a standalone widget or UI element then yes, you definitely can and should.

Semantics serve two purposes; you listed only one of them. Code is just as much written for the developer to read as much as it is for the browser or search engine to parse. Also, you are forgetting the entire ecosystem of web apps where SEO is moot and code cleanliness and readability is king.
You could do one of two things; you could have a hidden indeterminate progress bar element inside, or use the `progressbar` role configured to be indeterminate. Either way you should always have a `busy` attribute on the section that's currently loading. 

Progress bar elements are almost impossible to style at the moment (except in Edge) otherwise I wouldn't suggest a unique element at all.
Yeah of course. And we're supposed to use h1 for the page title. 

What I meant to say was back in IE6 days, with the exception of the basics semantic markup was more of an idea than a reality. HTML5 has really made it more practical
> It's mostly people using assistive technologies that could benefit the most from it.

**Could** being a major keyword here. The document outline effectively doesn't exist for screen readers. So it isn't currently helping anyone. Then once it does get into tech in like 10 years, people need to upgrade their software. Not sure what the screen reader update adoption curve is, but  if it is anything like other non-forced update software it will be a while.
dunno why post getting downvotes, i went straight using it when html5 came out, almost 10 years ago?
and saw no benefits using new tags since then beside my own code readability. 
also some of its use is debatable semantics side.
for example we have list of news posts.
whats the most correct way for its markup? inside <article>, <section> or <li> tags? with schema.org attributes. i still go <li>, but all these seem correct.
in the end, if we can still go with basic tags, plus aria codes for accessibility i think thats totally fine. and if you cant format your code in these conditions, theres something wrong with your workflow

No sure why you were downvoted. My experience has been similar. I mainly find these types of people have poor comments if any at all.
[deleted]
Yep. This kind of attitude suggests a general lack of knowledge or caring. They're usually awful.
Not sure, but it's primarily for web accessibility.
Just use nav regardless. This reasoning has no merit.
How do you know when to use section over article vice versa?
Exactly.
    <div class="bottom-row">
          <div class="panels-region-wrapper iustitia-region iustitia-region--bottom-left">
        <div class="panel-pane pane-views-panes pane-justice-news-panel-pane-front">
    <div class="panel-pane-inner">
                  <h2 class="pane-title">Justice News</h2>
                <div class="view view-justice-news view-id-justice_news view-display-id-panel_pane_front view-dom-id-65de1c8848eb93bbdb398847895def47 views-display-type-panel-pane">
      <div class="view-content">
        <div class="views-row views-row-1 views-row-odd views-row-first">
    ...
    <span class="field-slideshow-caption-text"><div class="field field--name-field-slide-caption field--type-text-long field--label-above"><div class="field__label">
    ...

If that's "semantic" and "valid" then I've got nothing to worry about!
"equal" is where the problem is. How much effort should we put in? How much should we be expected to? I remember a large company I worked for years ago had a court case brought by a man going blind and trying to improve accessibility. We were forced to undertake accessibility requirements to such a high standard that some of them actually weren't technically possible at that time.
I really disagree.

If my private business is primarily going to be used by non-screenreader reliant users, accommodating and considering the needs of screenreader reliant users may be written off as out of scope.

Maybe a competitor will cover that segment of the market.

This is obviously when considering a private enterprise. Public, we absolutely have to consider them due to ADA requirements. 
It's not even debatable. They're two separate words with distinct definitions. Both make you an ass, but they're not the same.
You're on an international website where the dictionary defines what words mean, not your local government. Discrimination is a conscious act, being inconsiderate isn't. Nobody fucking neglects to write their HTML semantically correct out of spite for the disabled.
I think he means how does it work with indexing. Google understands the different in semantics between an h1 outside a section and an h1 *inside* a section (or in nested sections).
I've only seen custom elements used with web components, which is a relatively new spec with still sketchy support. I wouldn't use custom elements for anything other than that.

User agents treat unknown elements as semantically neutral, and it would be impossible to infer any kind of meaning to them as they would differ per site. I don't see how this could ever be helpful unless you are Google and make a wildly used web component like <google-map> or something.

As for development, I'm not sure how much more readable it would be to have a custom tag than just using a capital first letter in the class name for components. All recent projects I've worked on have a strict only class name selectors anyway.
Ah crap. I was under the impression JAWS had implemented it back in 2011, but by the sounds of things [it was horribly broken and they backed it out entirely in version 15](http://juicystudio.com/article/html5-outline-algorithm-jaws.php).

I guess ChromeVox and NVDA (and even Apple VoiceOver and Android Talkback) get auto-updated a bit more frequently than JAWS?
The downvotes are probably because he implied anyone not using semantic HTML5 is a code monkey. 

One of the things I've noticed is that most people have some piece of tech they think is super important and if other people don't know about or don't understand its importance then they get written off as idiots. 

Maybe this guy has perfect HTML5 but doesn't organize/load his JS into modules -  what an idiot, right? 

No, it just means he hasn't had a need for them yet or hasn't understood the benefit, not that he's stupid or somehow lesser.  It's a noxious habit highly prevalent in this sub to judge people based off of their opinion on a single idea or piece of technology. 
[deleted]
When I use those technologies, would you expect me to make promises, list comprehensions, and stored procedures "the least of my worries"?
W3 (the organization responsible for html web standards) specifies how to use them [here](https://www.w3.org/wiki/HTML_structural_elements#Enter_HTML5_structural_elements).  Here's a good explanation on [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/a/24764861/4735355).

> <article> is related to <section>, but is distinctly different. Whereas <section> is for grouping distinct sections of content or functionality, <article> is for containing related individual standalone pieces of content, such as individual blog posts, videos, images or news items. Think of it this way - if you have a number of items of content, each of which would be suitable for reading on their own, and would make sense to syndicate as separate items in an RSS feed, then <article> is suitable for marking them up.

> In our example, <section id="main"> contains blog entries. Each blog entry would be suitable for syndicating as an item in an RSS feed, and would make sense when read on its own, out of context, therefore  <article> is perfect for them:

He also talks about how <section> can be used inside an <article> where it makes sense. Like when an article has sections like an introduction, conclusion, different chapters, etc. These nested sections are used to navigate in screen readers.
Sections are ... sections.  Article's should stand on their own.
Sections are broader groupings of elements. A section might contain a few articles.
Holy shit thats ugly.
If a field label isn't associated with either a label element and a for attribute or aria-labelledby a screen reader user won't know what the form field they are filling out is for.

It's a severe accessibility issue caused by non semantic HTML and I'm assuming it's in your code because you have div with a class of form-label

Edit: oh sorry I don't use Drupal often didn't get the joke ... nevermind lol
I love Drupal, but yeah, semantic HTML ain't its strong suit. A lot of government websites moved to Drupal several years ago. D8 makes some strides in this direction, so I hear, but I'm holding off on migrating my sites to it until the module developer community catches up. 
I was actually just making a purely definitional, linguistic point.  It *is* discrimination, but not all discrimination is necessarily intentional or equally bad.
Target, Peapod, H&R Block, and a few other companies were sued against ADA Title 3 for having inaccessible websites.  

http://www.dralegal.org/impact/cases/national-federation-of-the-blind-nfb-et-al-v-target-corporation
http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-enters-settlement-agreement-peapod-ensure-peapod-grocery-delivery-website
http://www.ada.gov/hrb-cd.htm
If your website in inaccessible to the point where you are prohibiting people with disabilities with doing business with you, then you are discriminating against them.  Whether you mean to be discriminating or not.
Wow, they have *international* websites now?
You've clearly never worked with Angular directives then.
They still don't have support for the HTML outline as far as I am aware.

To my knowledge, **semantic** HTML has nothing to do with a11y at all except for the baked-in role system. Other than that, at this time it is pointless.

Semantics only has to do with *human* readability at the end of the day. Which is fine. We just need to use things knowing this.

Search Engine bots have existed years before semantics and they work just fine either way. You aren't getting an SEO boost from it. So the bot stuff is ruled out. Except for the cases where you are building a site *to* be scraped by custom bots, but then I'd find another way to do that like microdata markup. In which case, elements are irrelevant.

A11y work will take quite a while to catch up and understand the HTML outline (if ever.) So you should still be building things with the traditional outline model in practice. This means using level 1 through 6 heading tags instead of only using heading level 1. Use semantic elements to **guide** your structure, not rule it with an iron fist.
I just had a quick glance at Google's search results page, and it's loaded with divs. I don't see any headers, navs, times, asides or sections. I also see ids and inline style tags and *gasp* script tags which *aren't at the bottom of the page!*.

*"but they're Google!"*

My point is, they do this stuff, and it's not 'cos they're dumb. There are legitimate reasons for doing things a certain way.
Or just don't build public facing apps...
[deleted]
It's not mine. I was just checking the DOJ home page to see how they use semantic markup to meet their accessibility requirements. It seems they don't (though apparently they do still support IE6). But what surprised me most was the complete absence of "aria" anywhere in the source.

I haven't touched Drupal since around 4.7, but I seem to remember being able to emit reasonable markup even back then if you create a theme from scratch. Everything-to-everyone themes tend to be loaded down with baggage in any CMS.

Depends on if you're conducting business in multiple countries ... Japan, the EU, Australia, and Ottawa Canada all have accessibility laws that focus that companies cannot have barriers to doing business with people with disabilities.
> They still don't have support for the HTML outline as far as I am aware.

Yes - I just meant users of those would likely get updates a lot more frequently than JAWS users.

> So you should still be building things with the traditional outline model in practice. This means using level 1 through 6 heading tags instead of only using heading level 1.

Understood, thanks :)
Likely they've just put their priorities into other things instead of updating their pages' HTML to be more semantic.

Which is I think the biggest reason why you don't see semantic HTML everywhere&mdash;there's not a large enough return of value for the effort of conversion.
for example no need for html5shiv.js
Clean code is also useful and can provide benefits to the end user. 
If something as easy and simple as semantic HTML isn't of value to you, how can your team trust you to respect the integrity of their project or the deeper parts of your own project's technologies?

That's when it matters more.
Of course it's code. It's just not *programming*.

It's still important it's clean, well-factored, idiomatic and readable.
Some tags can help with screen readers knowing what the shit is going on. There is a reason why they exist.
If I were maintaining a python/nodejs project, I wouldn't want another dev to make commits like they only know for loops ("what's a list comprehension or functor?") and not realizing that callbacks are not synchronous. So why do you embrace doing this to others?

If your definition of large app means to have large ``div`` mountains with lazily hacked use of classes from the current popular css framework, then sure. But I've worked on large projects with interns that show complete disregard for semantic HTML5, use ``i`` for italics numerous times after the company code standards and lead dev states to him that it's for icons and to use ``em`` or semantically useful css instead. I know what you are saying is fine for a cowboy coder on a small project who doesn't need the law, but in a team cooperative environment what you are suggesting is to make the templates messy and unreadable.
... *All* of them?

Not every accessibility aide supports every tag, but what did you *think* was the point of purely semantic tags like `nav`, `header`, `article`, etc? They have *no visual component at all* - their purpose is 100% accessibility (to people and automated scripts).
> you are comparing a very useful language feature in an actual programming language to something that provides very little benefit in a markup language

No, he's comparing a useful feature in a language you *understand* to a useful feature in a language you don't.
Some cool JavaScript:

    var var1 = "30";
    var var2 = " 3.14";
    var var5 = "70";

    var var6 = function (a, b){ var1 = var1 + 6; return a + b; }

I agree, semantic naming conventions are pretty useless.

I guess you would put something like a clock, date, or timestamp inside of a ``time`` tag. Sorry that doesn't excite you as much as ``<span class="time time-timestamp">``
I'm not really sure you have a legitimate point, I think you're just trying to pretend like you're a "real programmer" by trash talking the HTML equivalent of semantically useful naming conventions and pretending like something so trivially easy to do right is just beneath you and you only use real languages because only real languages have useful uses.
[deleted]
[deleted]
Yeah, I guess you don't have to use ``time``, they already made ``span`` for the "not ``div``" use case.
If you choose not to use semantic naming conventions, you'll get nothing out of it. Overall it will making semantically useful templates faster to read and write for the human and the machine. It may even reduce total lines of code in your app. It also fights against other code smells like the smurf naming convention.
[deleted]
> semantic html makes reading and writing faster "for the machine"?

I don't have a source for that, but that's also not what I said.

> I don't see how the new tags have anything to do with preventing smurf naming

Well that's OK, you're probably too busy http'ing concurrencies in real things.
There is no future proof framework. Future proof comes from your skills and experience, and as a beginner it's most valuable to really just exposure yourself to anything, everything.

I remember being so scared of wasting my time as a beginner. Spent so much time re-evaluating different options so I didn't make the wrong choice, but that's just not how things work. Skill and experience transfers across all languages and frameworks.

As a beginner, it's nice to optimize for ecosystem size since it'll be easiest to find help, tutorials, and resources. You can't go wrong picking between React, Angular, Ember, and other big names.

Just pick something that makes sense to you and start building. Nobody here can polish your decision down to a finer point than that because the difference between frameworks, at the end of the day, is a matter of preference and aesthetics, things you don't have until you've played around with the options and gain experience.

Remember, there is no "best". There are only trade-offs. Be wary of anybody that says that something is the best, and quit trying to find the best since it's a never ending quest.

Good luck.
Doesn't really matter. No matter which one you learn, most jobs won't be using it. There's simply no defacto front end framework. So if you want to have the best odds, maybe Angular but again, you'd be lucky if that even gets you a leg up on a third of the front end gigs out there.

Just focus on getting a very solid understanding of JS, jQuery, HTML, and CSS. Front end stacks are all over the place so don't worry about knowing all the thousands of libraries, frameworks, transpilers, unit testers, templating systems, and so on. None of them will take you more than a month to get a good handle on if you're using them all day.
React + Redux or React + Alt, and React Router. That's really all you need to get a React application going. Hell, you don't even need flux either, it's just a pattern of doing things a certain way.
Are you looking for changing language too?  If so then you could learn something such as Golang for an extremely fast backend.  It has a webserver builtin which beats nginx and apache, and it also allows you to hook into C programs so you can call more low level functions.  

Currently I do PHP + Golang.  PHP is for quickly getting something running and Golang for where I expect heavy load (like an API.)
then this flash back 

http://www.commitstrip.com/en/2015/09/16/how-to-choose-the-right-javascript-framework/

Most places want someone to know Jquery. Angular and React will have to fight it out for the future. I prefer React but my dad prefers angular. 
How good is your css?
This. You won't be wasting your time because new tools build on the ideas/practices of old ones at least. Vanilla Javascript/CSS will always be good to learn. 
Thanks, I'll look into some tutorials for React+Redux+React router stack.
I'm actually learning Elixir for the backend (it was the most innovant and drastic change for me since I already used Java and Javascript for the backend), which is really nice and it has Phoenix, which is a full stack web framework like Rails (created by former Rails core developers).

Elixir is based on Erlang (you can use Erlang and its libs within Elixir in the same code), it is a battle tested technology used since those 20 last years in almost all the telecom systems around us. It is fast, fault taulerant and designed since the begining to handle a lot of open connections at a time, so it's very scalable.
Whatsapp uses Erlang for their backend and this is why they can handle 900M users in a real time app (chat) with only 30 engineers and not a lot of servers.

You should check it, especially Phoenix if you like ''old school'' opiniated and well organized MVC frameworks with conventions.

I'll also check Golang, it was my second choice after Elixir.
Haha I laughed so hard when I saw it in 2015, especially because I was using Meteor at that time.

I forgot to mention that I'm very familiar with Meteor, on the full stack (using Blaze and Minimongo in the front end).

But now I'm trying to learn a front end more agnostic that I can easily plug anywhere and that is also more ''futureproof'' because people are now all abandoning Blaze and using React instead. It took me a lot of time to master Meteor and all what I learned in its view layer is now almost useless. Yes it is still usable, but when the community is not behind anymore and that there's virtually no company using it, I don't want to keep spending my time using it.
Good question. In fact, my CSS knowledge is very basic. I only used bootstrap a little and modified pre written style. I never built something on my own completely in HTML/CSS, I always use some templates that I modify.

So it should be a good idea to also learn CSS I think, but being a backend dev, what maked me wanna learn front end is the fact that front end is nowadays more complex than before and involves a lot of programming skills, websites are like apps today.
Learn how react works.  I don't use it but I use something like it.  It's they way things are going.  For now.

Was that a copy-paste from somewhere?  Sounds like an advertising piece :P

Erlang/Elixir was something I also looked at for heavy usage, but from the sheer amount of horror stories I heard about it I didn't want to get into it.
Oh Erlang.  It's unique alright.
/u/skini26 curious, why did you choose Elixir(erlang) over Golang? I'm  currently thinking of taking up Golang but am open to hear your pros/cons.
Wait what ??
 how is meteor out of the track !! 

Then I should change my vocation and become a developer evangelist haha.
Because of its functionnal paradigm and the way it handles memory (data is immutable and processes communicate by passing messages) so concurency becomes way easier to manage. And also because it is designed from the ground up to handle communication systems while golang is more general. It also has all those shiny features (thanks to its VM) like fault tolerance, easy horizontal scaling etc.

When I saw Golang, it didn't inspire me, it looks like C++ or Java or C#. I know Goroutines make concurency very easy too but the way to think in Golang is different. In Erlang/Elixir I feel like it's easier to think and design your code.

I really don't have a lot experience in Elixir, I'm just telling you what I understood after all what I read. I'm also reading the Programming Elixir book, which is excellent for any beginner in Elixir.

I also read from a lot of people that once you understand the functionnal paradigm and all the goodies that come with Elixir, it will be way easier to think and understand the flow of your code.


Meteor isn't out of the track at all, it's just all the controversy about its view layer (Blaze, which I really like).
Since React, everybody jumped on it and now React is also as much supported as Blaze on the Meteor platform.

That's why I want to learn another front end framework, so I could use it anywhere (I know it's also possible with Blaze, but it's not a ''standard'' way of doing things).
Thanks for the reply, it's a really good perspective on the languages. 
Keeping up with it all. Honestly. Its exhausting beyond anything. Getting started now is ridiculous intimidating. I think we need to figure out as a community how to streamline it all. There are 100 tools to do the same thing a different way. Does anybody agree or disagree?
A non technical boss who doesn't give you any freedom. 
having to work on windows for a .NET stack
I'm going to go top-3 on this, as it's hard to pick just one:

* Implementing a consistent, repeatable sales process which lets me hit my (admittedly aggressive) revenue and growth goals, first as a freelancer, and more recently as an agency boss.  It amazes me how most freelancers fail to achieve real excellence in this area.
* Learning and countering all the ways clients can bleed you out over money and scheduling.  Late payments, reserving time and then delaying, etc.  I have solid countermeasures in place against these sorts of things now, but it was a long and painful learning process.
* Insulating my productivity and mental clarity from the ups and downs of my personal life.  I'm quite grounded and stoic, but it seems that I choose partners who are the opposite. It can be hard to pull it together and go into a pitch meeting for a $50k project right after your girlfriend has a meltdown.
While trying to stay up to date with the endless amount of new tools, frameworks, methodologies is a close second, I think the age old, profession agnostic issue of dealing with people who think they know what they're talking about when they clearly don't will always be number one.

Whether it's a client who thinks he/she has a deep understanding of design/UI best practices, a senior colleague who is stuck in their old ways and refuses to listen to your rational suggestions or a PM who constantly puts you under pressure to hit a deadline that's not possible as they're unfamiliar with the complexity of the work to be done, it's still just as frustrating today as it was when I first got into this profession.
Forgetting how to save after vi'ing into a file.

Ended up learning vim commands. That has been the greatest challenge.

:wq
Having to figure out how to setup up an extremely busy service.  The API does ~100k req/s, cache servers do ~400k op/s.
I can mostly blame JavaScript for this. Developers in the 90's could learn PHP or Perl and be set for a decade.

I'm writing C in 2016 which uses the C89 standard - yes that's 1989. Ruby and Python, being the newer platforms, have had their share of BC changes, sure.

But the backbone -> angular -> ember -> react -> angular 2 hype, not to forget coffeescript/typescript/es6, and the nodejs/iojs split, could seriously have never happened on any other platform.
Tool development is a symptom of us trying very hard to automate ourselves out of our jobs. What today costs $9/month on Shopify would've taken months to develop 15 years ago. It's only going to get worse.
Agree... oh, how I agree.

It gets even worse when you have to continue supporting older parts of your codebase that were made using tools that were the new hotness in 2006. I've still got sections of the site using YUI2 (and YUI3) that I have to maintain because we don't have the budget or manpower to rewrite it. Keeping that old crap in my brain while trying to cram in the latest wonder-framework or the new features of ES2015 is soul-suckingly tiring.
Im actually thinking about getting into it as a career change. These posts aren't encouraging @.@
I agree with that 100%, but that's the cool thing :) There's no wrong way of doing something, because there are hundreds of tools to get you to the same or a different result :)
I would love something like this. I've been working for about 2 months on the change and I have a decent hold, and I am starting to feel like I'm getting over the hump a bit, but there are still somethings I'd like to get a better understanding on.

If there was a way to ELI5 on stuff like Angular and React and other Frameworks that'd be a huge help for me, but also a huge help for others that are trying to get into this. Not like a super indepth ELI5, but something just to make it less intimidating. For a while I thought Angular was an entirely different language, like learning JavaScript and then trying to learn C#. 
That'd suck! :(
I'm excited about being able to work on Linux with the .NET stack. I love the languages, I don't love the platform they live on.
why is this an issue, is it just an environment which you're not accustomed to? 
I wrote it kind of as a cheeky response but in all seriousness it has been a huge, unnecessary hassle. At first it was getting used to Visual Studio which is a huge bloated nightmare compared to my preferred editor (Sublime Text). But at least for that I got an IDE out of it. The problems continued when anytime I wanted to something suuuuper basic on the command line I had to use powershell which is just utter garbage compared to a shell on a *nix system. And then I had to work on updating an msbuild script and that...that was honestly one of the worst, poorly documented, incoherent freaking things I've eeever had to work with. Oh and then a million other things like trying to get a modern javascript setup, which is legitimately like 2 shell commands on os x, becomes a 10 step process involving updating c++ libraries (???) and python. Oh almost forgot there's a fucking pathname limit of 256...which is just hilariously fucking stupid. Oh man I'm making my self angry with this post.

I think windows as a dev environment is just about one of the worst things ever. It's just objectively inferior to working on linux or os x. Everything becomes this long drawn out hassle because the command line is garbage.
As a counter-experience,  .Net is thÃ© best stack i've worked with. Visual Studio is the best IDE available. Asp.net mvc is a great framework because its build on C#, which is the best mainstream language available right now. Everything actually works instead of having to work with 10 million build scripts to get gulp and grunt and npm and bower and ruby and whatever else you need these days working.
I'm an aspiring developer and student who is looking to escape my non web-related job... But I shudder at the prospect of working on the .NET stack... My experiences with it were not pleasant. Alas, 80% of the jobs seem to use it... Have you tried looking elsewhere or do you feel "stuck"? 
Yep I dev on windows (for now)... I have to say I run into that path limit more than one would think and it just makes me shake my head. Also my company's revisioning system is hosted similarly so no revisioning files that have long names for me. YAY!
So I'm actually a frontend developer. But at my current position I'm doing a bit of full stack development though I lean heavily towards front end dev cause that's what I'm good at and I can avoid using Windows/VS for the most part.

From when I was last looking for a job (~6 months ago), and from the amount of spam I receive on LinkedIn, there are a *lot* of jobs out there that don't require you to work in .NET. It's super popular for enterprise but there are a wealth of startups and smaller companies where you can work with any number of languages.

For reference, my last job was a startup with a mostly Node.js backend with some Go sprinkled in and the job before that was a Django stack. So this has been my first role working with an "enterprise" type stack.

The market is good enough that you can be picky with what stack you want to work on if you have experience. I actually chose to work on a .NET stack because I wanted to expand my skills by working with C#. I didn't realize how much of a pain Windows would be though lol.

If you don't have the experience to work on the stack you want to, I'd suggest working on side projects in the stack you want to work on so you have experience before you apply. I.e. "I want a node.js job so I'm going to write a node.js chat application on Github to show my abilities", etc.
Thank you, very insightful 
Snippets for Boostrap, then you need to implement Angular on template 
http://bootsnipp.com/search?q=chat
wow, please don't use update panels... That's a horrific plan. You'd be better served with a front-end framework such as angular while also making async (ajax) calls to the server to grab bits of data.
Though a better, more modern approach would be with signalr
Thanks everyone. I do feel about out of touch when it comes to modern front end development. 
There are many different ways to accomplish this. If you're using MVC you can write an action which returns a jsonresult containing the data you need. Then use javascript to make an ajax call to that action and update the page using the response as needed.
Ajax update panels
No
This. Whether it's using MVC's AJAX forms or using Javascript (jQuery, Angular, etc.), it should be handled by the front end. I'd recommend not using Web Forms any more...
Thanks I'll have a look. 
Ajax update panels are probably the .net answer to the issue at hand, but they are also a bit clunky and hard to configure correctly (at least i've found that to be the case) and MVC has much nicer ways of handling more dynamic content, especially with PartialViewResult responses, for me, it helps structure my partials to be completely dependant on a few select peices of information, and prevents me having GodModels
Is there a default.php or something like that? Or maybe a templates sub directory with all the page templates in?
/r/wordpress
Thanks for the reply! 
Inside the theme there are a bunch of php files, such as page.php but going through the files, i don't see the structure of the front page in the php code, whereas in another template i used, the front-page.php file was clearly the homepage
thanks ill try there!
You can usually see what template a page is using in the editor screen.
will it show me the specific .php file being loaded? i know im using the avada template, im just unsure how to access the "front page" php file, via ftp     

thanks
http://transithistory.org/ccreynolds/page.php-wordpress-template-i5.png

if you view the image linked, that is what im talking about. The text inside the select input comes from the comment tags of the corresponding .php file. Look at your php template files and at the very top the first line there is a comment with the template name. Match the template names from the edit page and php files and youve got your front.page php. 
Awesome, thanks for showing me that!
Np mate good luck with your developments.
Also, you can see the actual page in action yourself here http://ikermitkiller.github.io/paperframe-2016/
The background is weird and seems to be made with javascript? When scrolling to top it looks really weird.
Othervise it seems pretty good, hard to say more since I'm on mobile. Jave you forced the use of gpu with traslate3d 0,0,0?
> the main reason I'm making another is so we can use it internally at work (Although it's also publicly available)

Just curious, but why?
You may want to submit this to Supercharged! Paul Lewis does great videos about mobile web perf: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obtCN3Goaw4 (see link in the video description)

I didn't do a full audit, but I did glance a bit at [the source code](https://github.com/iKermitKiller/paperframe-2016/blob/8de81688df1cf09c10d2bdc61c50506e9c34f125/scss/import/_drawer.scss), and I see that you're transitioning on some non-GPU-accelerated CSS properties, such as `box-shadow` and `background`. Those are pretty much guaranteed to look janky on mobile; see [High Performance Animations](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/speed/high-performance-animations/) and [CSS Triggers](http://csstriggers.com/) for more details on this.

Also, I believe `translateX(-105%)` is more expensive than e.g. `translateX(-100px)`, because it has to calculate the layout width first (but don't quote me on that :)). You may also want to try putting a few `will-change`s in there (watch the Paul Lewis videos for details).
Could you explain a little more about the whole background being weird thing you mentioned? And yes I have tried to force the GPU to be used with translate3d, and in fact it is currently in use on the 'in action' link I posted. 
As of September last year, we're beginning to build a lot of web apps, and I mean a lot. We're currently based throughout three schools, which means upwards of 4000 students and roughly 1000 teachers could be using them (and using them often). With our user base so close to us, if something goes wrong they come straight to us. If something goes wrong, we'd like to know every bit of the code used so we can get it fixed and pushed out ASAP (something which can't easily be done when using 3rd party frameworks). 

We also just like to do things ourselves.
Thanks, I'll take a look at all of this later today. I'm sure if I can't  fix it fully, I'll at least manage to get animations to look a little bit better.
It is weird how the header background slides up and over the articles. It's a disconcerting motion because the animation doesn't work well, and perhaps no one expects a background header to suddenly move to a top level (and that really isn't material physics). 

Looks fine on my phone, maybe it's your potato that can't render it?
Any toolbars which aren't of standard height when a card is on top of it shouldn't have any elevation at all oddly enough, which is why they don't in my framework. I get that it just looks kinda weird and I've been trying to fix it for a while now but I can't seem to come up with a good solution for it.

And as for the phone issue, the Moto X Style ain't no potato. Which phone do you have? And does the input page (accessible through the drawer) run smoothly too?
dribbble.com and awwwards.com are great for inspiration.

Also maybe watch some UX/UI tutorials. Design is subjective after all. 
I would suggest if you want to learn front end, go fork other peoples creations over at CodePen and play around with it yourself :) Best way to learn is do a lot of trial and error yourself IMO.
A lot of common sense, but I like "Designing with the Mind in Mind. " I usually start with Bootstrap and just modify as needed from there. A lot of it, like color and form, are pretty similar to general design rules. For color,  I like this Adobe tool: https://color.adobe.com
Good design isn't about reinventing the wheel for every project.

Steal like an artist. Look at what websites are beautiful and reuse their styles. I always spend time on sites like awwwards, behance, codepen and Pinterest until I see something I like and use that as inspiration.

Steal like an artist - Austin Kleon http://austinkleon.com/steal/

I think the thing that would make the most impact in how visually appealing but also how usable a design is is typography. Once you get a handle on those concepts your designs will come together a lot nicer. A good primer is Thinking with Type by Ellen Lupton. 

alistapart.com can also be a good resource for some web design articles. 

I visit awwwards.com and siteinspire.com to see examples of what's trending in web design. 

I could probably dig up some more resources if you'd like. 
Honestly I look at design as something your just good at or not good at, you can get better at communicating your designs and you can build your visual palate over time, but some things you just have or you don't 
Well, it's not necessarily the technical bit, but how to make something visually appealing. 
ah, good luck with that haha. Everything I code is ugly. I fail in the beautiful department as well ;] I usually stick with copying existing pretty designs and just modifying them to my needs.
Well, learn a bit of Javascript as starter. This is a good book to read:
http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596517748.do

Then in the meantime add to your css knowledge. Here is a good channel for you:
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0abAX9cuVB0klLobCewq-g

If you like javascript, then the combination of AngularJS and nodeJS is a good one. There are lots of articles and tutorials. Try to build a simple API using NodeJS and use AngularJS to get the data from that API and present it in your client side web page.
Hey dude, thanks for the comment. I'm gonna be training JS soon. I looked into the youtube channel you linked, and i'm totally amazed. I never knew you could do such stuff only using CSS. Thanks a lot!
sure. No problem. watch them and also start experimenting with toy projects that you can come up with. Cheers and good luck.

I think online courses, things like CodeSchool, is a much more affordable and quite good option. You can learn a lot of stuff there, it will take some time, but if you do HTML, CSS, JS and Rails you will have a solid base for fullstack web development.
The answer to that is... maybe. Honestly, it really completely depends on the person and their learning style. I am personally self-taught but I have also taught one of these coding bootcamp courses so i've seen both sides of the coin. 

You certainly don't *need* to take a course but that doesn't mean they aren't helpful. The most important factor by far is your willingness to put in the time and learn the material. If you think you can just sit in a course, take some notes and that's it, well then no it won't help at all. But if you are willing to take the course, ask questions and then spend *much more* of your own time reviewing and studying the material then yes, it might be worth it. 


Do what I did, and learn the bare minimum of how to do web dev, and then somehow score an internship, and then get paid to learn.
I went to a web dev bootcamp in SF and have nothing but good things to say about it. I think the career services aspect of bootcamps is a huge advantage over community college or self-teaching but that's not the only reason I'd recommend that path. I was taught exactly what I needed to know to be an effective engineer out of the gate by gaining experience working in a team environment, following a scrum agile development cycle for my projects, and using VCS (github). I was so well prepared that I crushed my interview and my signing bonus (which I wouldn't have gotten with the career services support) was large enough to cover all of my tuition. This is in SF though where software salaries are gigantic.
Went to a bootcamp. 18k, which I still haven't paid off >_>, but I just pulled my first (technically second, though that's a longer story) programming job at 85k, in SoCal. All in all, great experience, would recommend. 
I've been considering a bootcamp and will probablly do one after the next summer. I was just thinking about this, if I would have had bootcamps available when I was making the college decision I would have done the bootcamp in a heartbeat. 

You will most likely learn very little from a universtity course and be around people who are there just to say they are there, learning on your own is possible but not as beneficial as the bootcamps. You will have people who have been in tech before there to help you and you will get out as much as you put in. So don't just go to go, go to learn and succeed in finding a job. I would learn as much before hand on your own and go to the bootcamp. You will meet similiar like minded people and depending on the camp/area greater success finding a job. 

MakerSquare is the one I am looking at since we have one in town. I studied finance in school and really enjoy coding so I would use it to do a career switch to something I enjoy.
Try freecodecamp.com. Its got a really big community so there's usually help in the chat rooms when you need it, and its kind of a guided self learning experience. I'm currently using it and I'm about 1/3rd of the way through and I really like it. Plus its free so if it doesn't end up being what you need, you can move on to something paid. I've also used team treehouse, and its great as well, really helped me to understand more advanced CSS and Sass.
Here's my experience. Before ever getting into web dev, I took some computer science classes at my university which helped expose me to lower level languages and how to logically think through problems. I also took a web dev class there, but it was super basic (HTML, CSS, a little js) as it was meant for art majors, so it was a waste of time.

 I searched around on reddit and found a lot of people like Treehouse. So I tried them out and they were great. They provide different tracks to follow depending on what kind of programming you want to do. Back end, design, front end..etc which made it easy to follow and learn without getting overwhelmed with different languages and which to learn first. So I learned a lot of useful and up to date info on HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. However, I knew there was much more advanced stuff I needed to learn in order to actually get hired as web dev. 

I had just graduated and student loans were approaching fast, so I didnt have a lot extra time to spend learning advanced topics on my own. I looked around at different bootcamps in my area, but they were all 10k+ and I didn't need more loans. However, I ended up finding a online bootcamp program, Viking Code School, that provided a payment plan where you pay 18% of your first year salary. So, you didn't have to pay anything upfront and you only began paying them back once you landed a job! A couple others do a similar payment plan. 

I decided to go for it and I learned a ton from them. The instructors hammered good coding practices, and code techniques that I would not have been able to learn as well on my own in the amount of time which I had. I was also paired with a programming partner which was useful because coding by yourself can get frustrating. On top of all the help, I had a ton of awesome projects that I could put on my resume. I really recommend the coding bootcamp, but it all depends on your situation and your willingness to learn. If you do decide to do a bootcamp, do your research on them, because a lot of them don't teach you enough to succeed at your future job. Good luck!
God this sounds confusing...

so here is the thing, college is always the option, you can always go and finish it, personally i'd tell myself to do it.. i just needed to spend time with 30 strangers...and grow as a person.


as far as web dev goes... you dont need cisc desgree... but first 4 courses of cisc are really helpful in understanding programming and learning to think in code. Now after that even if you finish college you wont know nearly enough to get a job or internship. However, Degree matters eventually in the career. So do get it if you can eventually. 


However if you teach yourself on the side while going to college this stuff: js, css, html, jquery, rails, ruby, nodejs, bootstrap, some linux, git/github, backbonejs, etc. You will be very ready for a job upon graduation.


Choose a path Front End or Back End.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB0WvcxTbCA


Go to bootcamp if you have money for 2 reasons: 

1) if you are willing to learn, then you can learn a lot in 4 months they will throw material at you and go in somewhat detail. It wont nearly be enough to make you a good programmer but it will give structured path which you can explore deeper on your own. This requires dedication, which honestly is not that hard to muster since you are paying 10-14k and are surronded by very dedicated students. 

2) Secondly, Bootcamps have connections. At least offline one. Some bootcamp's reputation depends on how many graduates get the job afterwards. So using their connections they get you paid internships that a developer with twice as knowledge as you, after finishing the bootcamp would have, wont get.  So unless your college is somewhat known for Computer Science dont expect college to be of any help in finding a job.




Now if you decided to learn on your own this is the path i'd follow:


 > Learn Html, Css (harder than it looks), Javascript, Cli, Git

 > Build a portfolio, use template if you need to.

 > Get Internship

 > continue learning

Start with udacity.com courses on web development. Really amazing. 


Use codeacademy to learn ruby, rails, and so on.


Always invest in books. 


Build Stuff, dont read forever. Make things and learn on the go. Only way to learn. Otherwise, you will spend months learning which you will just forget and will have nothing to show for it. 


It really depends on your style of learning. Think of any cost as an investment. Check out some bootcamps offered in wherever you want to study. Don't buy into any of their marketing though, they are a business after all. it'd be best if you had an acquaintance there so you can get some unbiased reviews. See if the environment and speed works for you, and measure the results of their graduates. 

As for costs, I learned on my own and it really took me years to become adequate enough to start consulting and getting job offers. Your learning speed will vary. Now really look at the costs. 

In the years I was learning, I could have raked in roughly 160k as a junior in those years. So time costed me more than 10k plus 11 weeks that a bootcamp would have offered. 

Consider time as valued for what you would be making when you enter the industry.

Source: I self taught over 13 years ago, bootcamps didn't exist. I currently know tens and tens of colleagues who went through bootcamps and my company hired several very talented jrs. It is definitely Not for everyone. 
Dropped out of College for Web Design/Development (due to outdated curriculum and incompetent instructors), went to a 9 week Bootcamp instead. Two weeks after graduating, received a job offer for a Jr. Dev Role, making 50K/year. Career wise, best decision I've ever made. 
I've got a 2 year community college degree in IT/PA and 6 years later I'm making $72 hourly which is enough cheddar to justify the cost for me.
I attended Hack Reactor in SF and it was absolutely worth it.  About 18 months after graduating, I'm making ~$130k.
This is a profoundly hard question to answer for lots of reasons, and it's affected my life as well. Here are my anecdotes for what it's worth.

I'm a UX designer/web developer with 5 years of full-time experience and a few more from freelancing, but I taught myself mostly everything. That said, I don't think that's what's important, or why I got my first job. After I graduated with a degree in Cognitive Science, I moved to SF totally unsure where I'd end up. I'd been making my own websites that used interactive SVG for my side-job as a DJ, and it wasn't long after making friends in SF that someone saw my work and offered me my first job in web development fairly serendipitously.

Three years later, a friend of mine wanted to change careers and learn web development. He had a degree in literature and decided to do a coding bootcamp nearby. He encountered a lot of problems securing a job. I think despite being a proficient enough of a coder, prospective employers didn't see that spark of innovation, curiosity, and autodidacticism that we look for. At the end of the day, I don't think he was very self-motivated to explore and create in the web realm on his own terms.

It's great that you're already following the webdev reddit â€“Â the next step, as someone who's been a part of hiring decisions before, is to get your hands dirty. Like, right now. Come up with something you want to make and start making it. Get lots of polished, deployed projects under your belt. Find someone more experienced to get advice from on how to move forward with your ambitions (this subreddit could be a great venue for that). If you discover at the end of making stuff on your own that you'd still have something to gain from college or bootcamp and that you're passionate about web development, give education a shot. You should avoid throwing money at something you're not sure you're excited about, because, believe me, you need to be passionate about web development to make a career out of it.
I was facing similair decisions a year or two ago, although I live in Sweden so my alternatives where a bit different.

I'm currently attending an webdev education I would classify as being somewhere in between bootcamp and collage. It's almost a two year program with plenty of internships, it's free of charge (state sponsored), and I'm eligable for student-loans/wellfare. (so I guess It's more like community collage, but with teachers that actually work in the buisness). And I'm really happy with it.

Before that I tried to learn c++ by myself. I bought some books, read some blogs and watched lots of youtube videos. And I must admit that it didn't work out very well for me. Even though I had a pretty clear schedule, which I stuck to. And I managed to learn a lot of complicated stuff during my 6 months, there was one big thing that was missing. And that was classmates! Not teachers or classrooms or stuff like that, classmates. People to discuss the material with, and to challenge and push you, it's worth a lot more than you'd think. And I'm not even an outward person, usually I can be pretty introvert.
But having that extra reason to think about the stuff you are trying to learn really is great. And also, I'm sure they'll prove to be very valuable to me in the end, because just knowing how to code really isn't enough, to get a job you need some contacts in the bizz...


I wrote an [article](https://medium.com/@jspenge/web-development-is-scary-70142ab034fd#.u1buo9z3x) on medium about this. What I noticed among a lot of aspiring web developers is a misunderstanding of jargon which leads them to struggling to know how to actually make 'something'. 

I think the best bet is to learn some languages that are used in some very common frameworks such as Python, Ruby, and JavaScript. Once you've learned one of these languages to a beginners level you are ready to start making something. You don't have to use a framework but it makes things a little more fun initially. 
[deleted]
I've never been to a coding bootcamp and I'm really just getting started in webdev - so take everything I say with a grain of salt. But I highly recommend looking at the curriculum before getting into community college to learn web dev. Look at the course catalog, look at the class descriptions, maybe shoot some emails to the dept heads.

It's true that they can often be outdated. Such was the case with my community college. I was ready to put the money down but I'm so glad I looked closely at the catalog first. They required Flash I, II, and III. Yet only one JS course. And one of their classes mentioned optimizing pages for browsers such as "IE and **Netscape Navigator.**" !!! 

Needless to say I doubt I would get a lot out of these classes that I couldn't get/haven't already gotten from learning on my own and from online courses. So my advice? Look at that curriculum closely, don't put down thousands of dollars for 90s curriculum. Not unless you are doing it to have something to put on the resume - in other words, you're doing it for a reason other than learning.

I actually did both CC & BC. I still feel like I have a lot of learning to do before I get paid to do it professionally. The certificate from a Community College was useful in the sense that it introduced me to the basics (HTML, CSS and concepts of OOP) but really I had no JavaScript experience until I attended the Bootcamp (except for Code School, Treehouse, et al) The camp I attended was pretty amateurish (young guys kind of making it up as they went along) but I managed to do it before they quadrupled the price(!). I managed to gain an understanding of the big picture but it was so scattered, I have spent the last year reinforcing those concepts on my own. Now after doing a zillion tutorials online, I'm trying to build something on my own to prove to employers (and myself) that I'm capable of doing this properly. We'll see where it leads. I think you have to find which learning environment works for you. I would've been lost at the BC without having a foundation at CC, that's for sure. At the very least, study Javascript book beforehand.
I had a great experience with a bootcamp, but it was really expensive.  Like you, I "didn't even know what I didn't know" so the bootcamp made sense.  However, if you're really *really* disciplined, I think you could probably learn on your own.  I actually started a blog to help people who are making the same decision as you are right now. [This post](http://www.codingbootcampguy.com/10-things-you-should-know-before-applying-to-coding-bootcamps/) gives a quick rundown of what you need to be aware of before committing to a bootcamp.  If you choose to self-teach, [this post](http://www.codingbootcampguy.com/what-do-i-need-to-learn-at-my-bootcamp/) is my attempt to outline the skills you need to learn to become a solid developer.
Coding bootcamps can often be a great opportunity for many people, especially when they are connected with network of employers already established, often paying for the student's fees. Here at Claim Academy (in St. Louis) we have a 95% placement with an average starting salary of $58,000. Our results speak for themselves. If you want to hear it from our grads, or find out any extra information about this topic, check out our website ( www.claimacademystl.com ) it really is helpful!
I will say this. I am on my 10th week of self-teaching myself web dev, and I can say: **DO NOT PAY 10k FOR A BOOT CAMP**

I was thinking about doing the same, but after researching and coming up with a plan I can say that I have learned an absolute ton within the small amount of time I have been doing this.

Look into getting a beginners book for HTML/CSS/JS John Duckett has two amazing books, and O'Reilly has great intro books for JS as well. Also look up Code School, Team Tree House, etc. You can learn a lot within a month of a cheap 20 buck subscript fee.

Also on top of that, and I can not stress this enough. Live in the irc channel: #learnjavascript. There are amazing as fuck developers in there that will teach you the proper ways of doing things and always lend you a hand. It's literally the online version of working with coders who are super better than you, and it starts rubbing off.

Also you need to set small and long term goals, and really decide how much time you're willing to put into this. If you do one hour a day, that isn't bad but you won't get a job for quite a while. But if you're slamming in 3-4 hours a day, you can easily get a job within a half year or less.

I would say to skip the boot camp, do some research, and really think about what you want to do. Front-end, back-end, and start from there. Then start with the basics of either of those.

Maybe the bootcamp is great and awesome, and maybe not. But I can confidentially say you do not need it to learn this stuff. 
DO NOT PAY 10k FOR A BOOT CAMP. Period.

If they guarantee you for a job placement then go for it. Else even if they have 5% failure rate you might fall through that crack.

There are plenty of online affordable ways to learn.

1. If you want to learn MEAN stack then do:
freecodecamp.com

2. If you want to go through Ruby on Rails route then do:
The Odin project.

3. Apart from those, get a 6 month free membership on pluralsight.com by registering on msn dev network. It is worth every penny.

4. In addition take related courses on Coursera, Edx or Udacity all for free.

5. Build projects and show those to prospective employers. 

And finally:

If you can convince you can do the sh*t  then you will have no problem finding a job.
Good luck.
Fuck that shit. Do CodeAcademy or something, learn the basics of a few different programming languages, and build yourself a portfolio. If you can demonstrate your competency and your ability to learn and adapt to new things, you're already head and shoulders above your competition.

There are always small businesses around town that need websites. Once you've got a handle on the basics, use that for resume/portfolio fodder.
I have a friend who completed a lot of online courses through team treehouse and then went and got into a Ruby on Rails trade school where they guarantee you employment. 

My brother on the other hand went to university and got a computer science degree.

My friend still works retail, but my brother makes 6 figures. Both of them graduated from their programs last year.

Get a degree, it's worth it. 
It's encouraging to know you can earn a good salary starting out without a degree. I don't have one either. Glad bootcamp worked out so well for you. :)
thats a big somehow!
I have been teaching myself web dev for about 5 months now and I'm trying my best to get an internship but not even getting replies :/ Any ideas that can help me get an internship?
Can you describe your job more? You said programming, is it web dev? Front or back end?
Wow, 18k. How long was it and what did you learn there?
What scool? Did you specifically learn web dev?

Edit: I saw it was hackreactor below. I hear the application process is more selective than Harvard, or something like that. WHat made you stand out as an applicant?
Nice, I like freebies! I'll give it a go. :)
I've seen Viking Code School before when researching bootcamps and was thinking of giving it a shot. Did you land a webdev job after completing VCS and how long did it take you to complete it (if you have yet)? How does coding with a partner work on an online course? Really appreciate you taking the time to answer, thanks. :)
Did the Viking School offer any kind of job finding assistance?

Which school?
Did I give you the impression I'm not learning it for the right reasons? :)
But do you have a job yet? 
Thanks, perhaps I should have specified though that I'm nearly 29 and feel as though it's a bit too late for that, assuming you mean a 4-year degree. I kind of just want to learn to code, not take classes like English and Math that I'm not really going to need in my career, which is why I was considering either bootcamp or the CC certificate. I was under the impression that in webdev, your programming knowledge and portfolio are more important than a degree. Would you disagree? Why do you think your friend didn't land a webdev job?
I got my internship through an intern program, and I'm a university student, so I had it a bit easier than just heading out and trying to find an internship.

Your best bet for finding an internship is probably to wait until all the companies are looking for interns towards summer break, and jump on the bandwagon.
I'm not totally sure yet, as I haven't started and I don't know what team I'm on, but it should be backend user tracking and engagement stuff. Maybe java, maybe Scala, certainly javascript.

In the job I just left, I was doing mostly mean stack front-end work, with some aws devops thrown in as well. 
3 months, 12 hours a day, 6 days a week. Basic programming stuff like algorithms, data structures, etc; individual javascript frameworks like angular and backbone; databases (Mongo, SQL); professional development; project work. It was absolutely worth it. 

It's called Hack Reactor, if you're in the market. 99% job success within 3 months (I'm actually one of the 1 percent; took me a little over 3) @ avg 105k (though that's normally in the SF area--adjusted for cost of living, I'm making about the same in LA). 
Hard to say what made me stand out. I'd guess it was the fact that I had taken a few cs college courses (cs 101 and 102, nothing too fancy), and that I crushed the application material. Self study is the key! 
Late reply, havent been on reddit in a while. Yes, I landed a webdev job after completing the program. Actually, I was offered a job before the program finished and leaving the program a couple weeks early in order to take the job (but I kinda regret it because I missed out on some final project work.) 

It took me about 3 months to work through the program.My cohort was about 14-15 weeks long. Which, I think, is a bit longer than I a lot of other bootcamps. 

Coding with a partner online can sometimes become a bit frustrating, because you have to constantly be communicating, so it isn't like I can point at the screen or rip the keyboard away from them in order to quickly explain the way to solve the problem. You have to stop them and logically explain how to solve it step by step. This is probably a better way to code (and think) anyway, but can be frustrating if the partner isn't listening or you feel the deadline approaching. But its much much soo much better than coding completely on your own. It's nice to struggle with someone else, it'll help keep your sanity while you code. 
Sorry again about the late reply. 

Late reply. Haven't been on reddit in a while. Not me personally, but other classmates received some help. I received an offer for a job before completing the program, but I'm sure they offered assistance to those who needed it. A lot of it is on you. You have to make the resume, build the portfolio and, send it out to all the potential employers. They help tweaked my resume and prepared me for interviews, but the actual funding the job aspect was mostly on me.
[HackerYou] (http://hackeryou.com/)
You don't give off the impression, but web dev from my experience or any kind of software developing, would be logical thinking. To be honest just going over HTML, CSS, and JS is just not enough. The most valuable skill in all this is logical thinking, being able to solve problems or think them through. 

So if you're sitting around thinking web dev could be a 'cute' job, meaning 'hey, this could pay my bills, and allow me to go clubbing, or get them Birkin bags, or whatever!'; ........lol.....then it will humble you. Software dev for me is something that doesn't seem to be a job you can 'turn off and on'. When not at work, you should code in your spare time or do something involving code. 

Like Math if you don't use it you'll lose it. I plan on there being an influx of junior to mid tier web developers in the coming years. Those that are good enough to make it a few rounds, but don't really want tot do this. It's just so damn hot right now, people are jumping in......until this bubble bursts. Those that are doing web dev now but are in it for the long haul....by the time the new comers arrive they should be onto different languages or on the Senior Dev path.

-Just sayin'
No no, just from other comments I have read in the past. You definitely did not give me any reason to believe you are doing it for the "wrong" reason - obviously no reason is wrong, I just feel if someone has the passion to solve problems or build things to solve those problems they would have a more satisfactory time in web development but once again that is my personal opinion on the matter.
Havent started looking yet. 
I feel ya. I'm graduating when I turn 30. But the job I can get right out of school is better than what I could work up to in three years in the professional world. Also, if you want to make the big bucks you have to just bite the bullet and learn to get good at math. There is no shortcut if you want to be a truly good dev. But learning math isn't as hard as you think. Everything builds off calculus, all you need to really know like the back of your hand is that. Everything else you just have to understand conceptually and know how to get a program to do that.

Now if you just want to be a web dev, but not an actual programmer, then go for it, but you'll have far less job security and far less employment prospects. There will be a ceiling on what you make that is lower than that of your graduated peers. 

Look on the bright side! Why do you want to skip college? College is way more fun than the working world. 
I would absolutely disagree. What you get paid is based on what you can bargain with and a degree is a much bigger bargaining chip. Plus there is no guarantee that a self taught programmer has a comprehensive knowledge. Because they're self taught they could have gaps or bad habits. Also a degree shows commitment and hard work. It will always set you ahead. If you want to start at $65-75,000 don't get a degree. If you wants start at $90-200,000, get a degree. 
Good to know. Thanks!!
Just curious..

When you are applying for these programming jobs as a bootcamp graduate, do you use your instructors as professional references? How much did you end up spending again for the bootcamp? Thanks


ah canada
What makes you think there is a bubble?
Then I definitely don't think you're in any sort of position to give career advice to anybody, especially in **ALL CAPS BOLD**. I agree that a capable person can learn JS basics from books and online resources, but OP's goal is getting a job.    
You're on your 10th week of self-teaching yourself web dev and haven't even started looking for a job yet? I say you focus on yourself before handing advice out, you might be in for a rude awakening when you start your job hunt...    

Source: I went to a bootcamp. I landed an awesome job that I love, where I get paid for the code that I write. The increase in my salary has already paid for the bootcamp. 
Umm, a few reasons...first one being it's a lot of time and money. I don't need to go to college to have fun, I have plenty of fun in my personal life. I probably wouldn't find hanging out with a bunch of people 10 years younger than me "fun" anyway. Coding appeals to me and I want a decent job that doesn't require a lot (more than 2 years) of schooling. They are out there. I know a BA is going to look good on a resume, but there's plenty of people who became successful as a webdev without a degree. Hope this didn't come off bitchy...I applaud you for going to college, I'm just saying I don't believe university is the answer for everything. There's plenty of college grads who can't find more than a minimum wage job after graduating and have to move back in with their parents, you know?
I think what you're saying has truth, but I've seen a lot of bad habits in new graduates, lots of gaps in knowledge too. 
And I am also curious like /u/biancabeexx said, why do you think your friend didn't land a webdev job? Are they still looking?
I personally didn't put them as references on my resume. And, I didn't fill out that many job applications that asked for references. In total, I spent $10,500, but I didn't have to start paying them until after getting a job.
It just reminds me of the PC repair days with A+ certs and such, by the year 2020 web development could be a $12 an hour job in some places, it becomes too saturate. 
I'm self-taught and have got a job in development and the are definitely many others on here who have as well.  However even I wouldn't tell someone who learns better in a classroom environment to attend a Bootcamp.  It will be more valuable for resume and networking purposes, and should be more qualified given that you've worked under the kind of true professionals I've wished I had many times throughout my experience.  10k is a solid investment for an in demand industry with upward mobility.  Just pick a good bootcamp.
That's cool it lands people jobs on finishing it, then hell, sounds legit. You can easily just pay back the money you spent on the bootcamp within a month or so. 


I don't know. But does it matter? That story is pretty common. Get a degree, it's far more than worth the time. 
> You can easily just pay back the money you spent on the bootcamp within a month or so.   

No, realistically it takes several months
Yes but it's well known that time is far from the only limitation to a college education - in this country, at least.

I am not completely disagreeing with you here. But knowing what kind of person your friend is might also shed light on why they don't have a dev job. We all know that one person who "can't" find a job - right? Education is definitely a factor, but I think it's unfair to say that it is the only factor, or that other factors don't matter. They certainly do.
For some people, yes, it's absolutely worth it if you have the time and money. For others, no. It all depends on what sort of occupation you want as well and a BA isn't a necessity for webdev. Ofcourse it will look good on resumes, but I think my money would be better spent on a good bootcamp if I had that kind of cash to throw around.

I hear ya. Iâ€™m just saying, my buddy did one of those programs and he still doesnâ€™t have a job. My brother got a degree and was hired for six figures straight out of college. Like, the rest of your life can completely change for just a few fun years as the cost. Wheres the downside?
Well, you can't generalize degree vs. no degree in the tech world based on only two people! Perhaps your friend was a slacker or coding just wasn't really his thing. Or a million other things that can be a factor. Also... http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-12-16/sheryl-sandberg-says-business-school-doesn-t-matter-in-tech most people would agree they're not necessary in this field.
Theyâ€™re absolutely not necessarY. Its just a harder road without the degree
Be as formal, forward and transparent as you can. It pays off. For the project files, I like to give access to the client in day 1. I have my own gitlab instance that I can use so it doesn't cost me a penny. Most clients are not as technically savvy as to be able to set up those things for you. Most of them don't even check the progress in the source code. They want to see visual things, so you are probably better-off with a staging site. Even then, the most effective way to communicate progress is through person-to-person meetings, if you have that chance. 
I would recommend for you to buy hosting or VPS according to the project's needs (it is you after all the one who probably knows best), and then agree with the client to transfer the hosting to him. 
Go to the trouble of a written contract. You don't have to use legalese, just put the important matters for you there. A page of a written agreement in a semi-formal language is better than not contract at all, and it provides a working framework for the relation with your client down the road.
I think its a mutual agreement. If they provide those for you then you are fine because you dont need to maintain anything as long as these things have been talked through. If client does not have any clue and you need to take care of all, then you should have all in the agreement.
what you can do is to start developing an API with couple of endpoints that provide data to frontend. Maybe querying a database could be a start or calling another api and then provide its data to frontend. 
I was in your situation not long ago. I decided to utilize Node to automate miscellaneous computing tasks. For example, I finished a small script that sends an HTML formatted email, every morning, that covers my usual reading habits (r/webdev posts, news articles from various publishers, etc.).

Take a look at some database manipulation, cron jobs, read/write local files, etc. My interest with the server-side is manipulating stored files, running automated tasks and the like. As you've mentioned, there's more to Node than simply setting up a web server.
What are you trying to make? All node does is spit out data to the front-end, so you need to consider why what you're making will not work without server-side code.
Actually my end goal is to be able to automate things on my server through a web panel. For example starting a new voip server by the push of a button. I'm not that new to the server side as a whole. I'm aware of how cronjobs etc work. What I'm really having a problem with is telling my server to do things through events on my website. I'm having trouble to find guidance to simple things such as putting a button on my website, which when clicked runs a node.js file on the server. 
Well, for now this is just educational. Things I would like to be able to make include but not limited to: - automation for hosting, automatically set up a kvm after payment has been received. - cms. - perhaps a small game. 

To be fair, for now I just want the knowledge. I don't have a set idea of what I will do with that knowledge. I just want to be able to make the back end of my server do things for me. Right now I have express set up to do exactly what any other web stack can do for me, but I want more of it.
For something like this, you'd want to create an API with endpoints for each of those automation actions. So when you click that button in your web panel, your client fires off an AJAX request to your Node API, which then handles running the task on the server.
I am making an assumption but it sounds like you need to focus on learning how to program. Forget the web for a second. You chose to use Node so you need to get a good grip on JavaScript. Try making a simple command line utility or solve anything from /r/dailyprogrammer. Then I suggest trying to solve an actual problem you might have or trying to implement an idea you have, this will make you motivated and learn faster.

Once you have the conceptual basics you can try to interface with a database or api's on the web. You can make a reddit bot. Go nuts. Also remember that besides reddit there are other good resources for help. The freenode irc server can be a life saver as there are chat channels for lots of major open source software projects as well as most major languages.

I'm saying this because learning express or whatever other framework is kind of pointless for you at the moment. It is solving a problem you don't yet have.

Feel free to hit me up with any specific questions, even stupid ones.
Wordpress would be a good start. If you know a bit of programming in  PHP and javascript, you can customize it for your need.
Hey, You could use Wordpress its pretty simple if you are somewhat tech savvy. there are plugins that allowe Facebook login and probably some plugin to add reviews or something alike. Good luck
If you go with vBulletin, I suggest using their vB4 version. I make 3rd party apps and have used all, that's definitely their more stable version and it's packed with extensions. Definitely wouldn't suggest their cloud. 
I second using [SiteGround](https://www.siteground.com/go/webhostingwhys) for Wordpress hosting. 
This is webDEV not webAPPS...
How is developing a WEBAPP not WEBDEVELOPING?
1. Open notepad

2. Write your html, JavaScript, CSS

3. Save that file as "my site.html"
(Save on your desktop so you can find it immediately)

4. It will save as a file which will open under your default browser. 

5. Click on your file on desktop. Hip hip hooray! There's your website. 


Bear in mind this is a local website so only you can see it. It is not up online for people around the world to see. 

In order to that you need to buy hosting. Couple euro a month. And then upload your site onto that server. 

If your only learning, building local sites does the job. 
What do you mean compile? You don't have to compile HTML and CSS.
I think what you are seeking is a nice text editor that will give you syntax highlighting for whatever language you're working with. There are many that are free. Go in search and try them out until you find one you like.
HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP are mostly used for web development and none of these need to be compiled. You just throw the files on the server.

I'm pretty sure you meant JavaScript rather than Java. As Java is not really used in wed dev. If you did mean Java most IDEs have built in compilers. I would recommend Eclipse or NetBeans for your Java needs. 

NetBeans can also be used to write the usual web dev languages i mentioned above, but most people find it a bit heavy for front end work. For that its probably best to use SublimeText3 
You're using the word "compile," which is causing confusion. Compile has a specific meaning in programming that is totally different from how you're using it.


eclipse
well, Java is a bit off if you want to do frontend development. But use sublime 3 for your frontend development.
Then use this tutorial on how to have a good workflow for your frontend development:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCW3Q28QXIs
Might have phrased it incorrectly.A program that can "Compile" all my code like put it together and run my website.
Yea I did mean javascript my bad.Maybe I need to make a server or something? Then dump the code onto there -.- sorry never really posted a website.Basically I want to figure out how to post a website.
Basically something that can keep all my website files organized like visual studio has a project files etc, keeps everything organized easy to access.Because right now I have to keep changing my html extension to txt then back and forth really annoying.
Chrome? Firefox? I.E.?
HTML is not compiled. I think what you are wanting is to right click the file and open with a web browser
You don't "post" a website. You need a domain and a webhotel on which you can host your website.
Only crazy new frameworks require compiling. Basic sites do not. Check out NetTuts or Lynda for tutorials to get you started

Edit: also Java and Python but sounds like you haven't delved into hose yet for web development 
You should check out one of the popular text editors. Sublime Text 3 and Atom are very popular.

As far as changing file extensions, I don't see why you'd have to do that ever. You can open a .html file in any text editor (notepad included) and edit it directly.
baby steps lad, baby steps.
Yea I worded this question wrong, I basically wanted to find a program that can organize my files and everything like visual studio.
Try Visual Studio Code then. Or Brackets, or Atom, or Sublime. Sounds like you are looking for a text editor or IDE. You could always look at webstorm too.
Yea one of my friends mentioned webstorm to, thanks for giving the advice.
What do you mean by 

>  I have no idea how to do anything

Taking on work and failing is a quick route to destroying your reputation. If your not confidant in your abilities, you should probably work with a team until you are. 
To be blunt, successful freelancing doesn't just happen. It is very difficult work and you really need to know what you are doing to be successful. 

Not only is freelancing a business, you have to handle *all aspects of it*. You are not just the coder but also the accountant, customer service, marketer, etc...

That is to say, freelancing generally arises naturally after working and gaining expertise in a field after years of experience. It is almost never a good idea (or even attainable) for someone to just jump into. 

 I would not recommend freelancing to anybody that is just starting out but instead "outsource" those difficult parts of freelancing to an employer. You can provide them with your services while you can basically learn the ropes on their dime. Otherwise, you will be trying to learn everything and feed yourself and that is a recipe for disaster. 

Iptables is a firewall, fail2ban is a brute force prevention server.  Fail2ban scans the logfiles, using scripts that you made, to stop malicious attempts at logging into services, looking for exploits, that sort of thing.  It then uses the firewall to block the ipaddresses from the people trying to do harm. 
[deleted]
both, mainly because fail2ban uses iptables.
Iptables should be the one limiting what you are exposing to the world on your server. Allow only services you want from IPs you want. 

Fail2ban should be handling any mass brute force attempts and alert you on those services being attacked. 


Keep your attack surface small. Only put on the internet what you must through iptables
ConfigServerFirewall will give you an easier way to manage your firewall. 
I'm no /u/Vekseid, but I have basic implementation fleshed out at:
https://github.com/bradchesney79/2015DebianJessieWebserverProject

Both basic fail2ban and IPTables are implemented-- in a way that breaks SFTP Filezilla access, but not CLI SFTP through the terminal (yeah, I put it off, I'll figure that one out later).
I don't use fail2ban at all. It serves little purpose if you are doing everything else right (key authentication, etc).

[I have written an extensive, documented IPTables script](http://hexwiki.com/wiki/Iptables_%281.4%29) if you are interested.
cloudflare. problem solved.
I'm going to have to get this to work then. I did before, I wrote this long list of steps for server security and I lost it! ahhhhhh

&nbsp;

Any tips if I don't have any modules at all? Particularly ip_conntrack/ip_conttrack_ftp, that's what I had problems with on Debian 8
That's exactly it.


... Or other means to block IPs
Are we strictly talking about ports or folders as well? When I create individual wordpress installs per directories, this concerns me, like what is the user doing with that wordpress account?
Is that part of linux like apt-get install ConfigServerFirewall?
How would I implement this? Download/upload? wget? copy into modules?
Fail2ban is really just defense in depth. You're right that it doesn't do anything to protect against known threats if you are otherwise protected against known threats, but not all threats are known and heuristic defense against bad actors may buy you margin against unknown problems.
How does key auth prevent a script hitting unauthenticated parts of your site (eg the home page) repeatedly?
There is no point in allowing an IP that you know is bad to continue communicating with your server. Especially when installing f2b is all of 10 seconds with the modern packages out there.
My main motivation for using fail2ban is simply accumulating less useless spam in log files. I agree it is not important for security if you are doing things right (but it doesn't hurt either).
I am interested. I have yet to use key authentication. not sure if related, ssh not using password... I tried to set up keys before and had problems.
I've seen a site use that, you get this message like "Checking your browser" or something like that, then you are taken to the website. I have heard a lot about it.
Sorry I don't have any fail2ban scripts for them. Mine are for mailserver and freeswitch. I let the lfd module for csf handle ssh security.  

Csf is a manager for iptables and it has a module called lfd that handles some security to.  http://configserver.com/cp/csf.html
Look into that. It might solve your problems a bit easier.
You should use chroot for locking users into their own folders. Then you have built in permissions and groups to control who can access what folders which is built into Unix. If you are talking like forensic stuff to keep track of a user history with files they are working on, there is processes that will run on Unix systems that will keep track of file reads and writes but take tuning for larger servers so you don't have performance hits. 
It is still in flux as work continues-- how I test that I haven't broken anything to the Nth degree is that I fire up a blank Debian 8.1 linode, ssh in to it, and:

    date +%s >> /root/time.txt; pushd /root; mkdir bin; pushd bin; wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bradchesney79/2015DebianJessieWebserverProject/master/build-script.sh; wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bradchesney79/2015DebianJessieWebserverProject/master/add-web-person-user.sh; wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bradchesney79/2015DebianJessieWebserverProject/master/add-website.sh; wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bradchesney79/2015DebianJessieWebserverProject/master/troubleshooting.sh; wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bradchesney79/2015DebianJessieWebserverProject/master/backend-build-chain.sh; chmod +x *.sh; ./build-script.sh 2>&1 | tee /var/log/auto-install.log; ./backend-build-chain.sh default-web default-web-db-password TRUE datalord seconddummypassword /var/www FALSE 2>&1 | tee /var/log/auto-install.log; date +%s >> /root/time.txt; ./add-web-person-user.sh bradchesney79 TRUE 2>&1 | tee /var/log/auto-install.log; usermod -a --groups default-web bradchesney79 2>&1 | tee /var/log/auto-install.log; popd; popd

Currently, that monolithic multi-command line I cut and paste into the CLI just churns through the scripts in turn (by ending each command with ; instead of && -- which makes the following command dependent on the prior command exiting successfully).

That leaves me where I am currently at, setting up sentinel (for authentication & Access Control Lists(ACL)) and making it accessible to a front end with a REST API.

I'd like to 'include' a config file and have a single script kick things off with the last thing in each script being the command to cut/paste to continue to the next stage.

This is my Ansible road map. Why? Well, tools specifically for provisioning servers have things built in that make this nicer. But, but, it is in bash and you keep using bash? Yes, I am most comfortable using bash and it lets me see that everything works when I have full control over what is happening. It is going to get to a point where I want other people to be able to more easily benefit from my work (even if I don't release a good version until Stretch...). That is where Ansible will shine.

And, I would love any help people have to add-- even if it is suggestions. I know I want to do a better job with iptables and possibly fail2ban rules.
If all it did was notify of suspicious activity, I'd be more open to it (I should probably check if that's a useful option now, but the point stands).

I have been burned by following overzealous security methods. Real humans have misconfigured routers, malware, virus scanners that act like malware (AVG), and other such issues. Bloating your IPTables ruleset has its own costs.

In particular if all you are doing is setting up something like this 'in ten seconds' and forgetting about it, security-by-checklist style.

Well you can do that sort of thing in just plain IPTables (see my script). At issue is the fact that some users will have routers or browsers that excessively spam requests, so you have to walk a delicate balance there.

Of course, you can just consider those people a loss, but often, they are in fact real humans.
It doesn't. SSH public key authentication is all about locking down SSH. 

Blocking some sort of DoS attack on a web server is a more complicated matter. Fail2Ban can use Apache logs as a source so you can block an IP after hitting a page some ridiculous number of times. Apache can also do some simple blocking like denying or redirecting requests that don't have referrer headers set correctly. 

To really mitigate a DoS to a site a CDN is usually the best bet. A DDoS works by saturating your server's capacity. Offloading requests before hitting your hardware (load balancing from a CDN) can stave off that kind of effect. 
What problems did you have? Were you following a guide somewhere?
I'm wondering if I should have them in their own virtual environment rather than a direct folder. This is good stuff, thank you for telling me about it.
Looks like I can 'source' the config file... which it doesn't do now.
I lost you on the REST part... who has REST? I thought this stuff was your problem to work with. From my meager understanding of REST, allows phones to connect to servers... that doesn't make sense. HTTP... something... yeah. Lost me. I just think of it for Android applications/mobile applications pulling data/inserting data... so regarding the context of the bash and f2ban/iptables, what do you mean with the REST part?
> If all it did was notify of suspicious activity

It is configurable to just send an email when it detects suspicious activity.
This is the guide I was following. I have two Debian 8 servers and one of them I followed through this tutorial with no problems, except for the saving, I had to use the n-version of saving. Anyway.... I'm not sure why I suddenly ran into ip_conntrack_ftp problem, where the ip_conntrack module didn't exist... my etc/modules was empty

http://bencane.com/2012/09/iptables-linux-firewall-rules-for-a-basic-web-server/
Yes. Sandbox to their own user home and don't trust your users esp if they are using wordpress and installing plugins from random sources. Cpanel did do a good job of splitting user space up pretty well and automating the DB and directory permissions and following those is good to lock your users into their own homes
The beginning of how I set up iptables and make them persistent are from:

Line 302 of the build script
https://github.com/bradchesney79/2015DebianJessieWebserverProject/blob/master/build-script.sh#L302

to:

Line 401 of the build script
https://github.com/bradchesney79/2015DebianJessieWebserverProject/blob/master/build-script.sh#L401

Realize that Line 302 installs a lot of other packages that have nothing to do with iptables. An important one is installed later on line 331 for persistent iptables.
REST is a way to spill out DATA based upon a request that is complete in and of itself. The official term is STATELESS. (Complete mumbo jumbo, there is always a state and it is stored somewhere in the things I build.)

If everything is hunky dory and completed in what is considered a timely manner, then \*poof\* the data gets returned to the requesting node.

If something takes too long or the REST request is not sufficient (timed, out, incomplete, not authorized...) then a smart person sends some error data to facilitate handling the problem on the front end.

The request can come from a phone.

It can also come from an AJAX call from an AngularJS web app ( http://andyshora.com/promises-angularjs-explained-as-cartoon.html see the son service with the $http.get() function).

A POST request via jquery.post()  ( http://api.jquery.com/jquery.post/ ) is a perfectly valid way to interact with a REST API.

It can come from a cURL request from a back-end process ( http://www.codingpedia.org/ama/how-to-test-a-rest-api-from-command-line-with-curl/ ).

The API doesn't care.

Applicable XKCD ( https://xkcd.com/1053/ )
Ah. I use logcheck for the most part, personally.
I am not sure what that line is doing in his tutorial. I have never run a proper ftp server - just sftp, so it may be necessary for old-school ftp services. 

Generally, the ip\_... modules are now aliases for the netfilter (nf\_... ) modules. run modprobe -c through grep to see what I mean. 

Run lsmod | grep conntrack and see if nf_conntrack is already in there.
Man so much information, I really appreciate the help guys.
My current work involves using Sentinel ( https://github.com/cartalyst/sentinel authorization & access tool ) to authenticate people via a REST API. I am expecting people to provide credentials by filling out two fields on a front end and submitting. That complete request should trigger things in my distributed server side storage in memcached as well as the database. If I get just a user name or just a password-- well that request will be incomplete and error data will be sent back to prompt a complete request.

If requests in series go bad, error data will be sent and Sentinel may begin penalizing or even blocking the user entirely on subsequent requests.
thanks, this is good to know for future application
I will try that. Curious... regarding FTP SFTP... when you use Filezilla to connect to a server, I think that's SFTP, what is FTP? I rent through OVH and their servers are preconfigured to be accessible by Filezilla which is what I use to transfer files.
Wordpress-- so PHP. For chroot and segregation of resources look at PHP-FPM.
Filezilla is an ftp client that is capable of supporting sftp. I have not used it in a long time personally as everything I do now is protected by key authentication. I use WinSCP instead because it integrates with PageaNT. Filezilla might do that now too, but still.
Back in the stone age, File Transfer Protocol was a tool to do the job of transfering files-- it ran on port 21. It sent everything plain text if not binary. Some people thought that was too insecure for their tastes.

Secure File Transfer Protocol works similarly, but with encryption in most if not all implementations. It communicates over port 22 by default-- that should ring a bell, SSH. I'm not sure exactly how it rides on the coat tails.

But, FileZilla can do either and they are both used today. I avoid FTP the best I can. FileZilla will use SFTP if you specify sftp://domain.tld or domain.tld:22 and I believe FTP as with ftp://domain.tld or domain.tld:21 . How much is convention and how much is probing or advertising, I don't know.
Thanks. I meant that in a good way, I keep tabulating more words to look up and new topics to delve into.
I keep seeing this key authentication, I will look into that as well then.
I specify port 22 and this seems to override the IPV4 address I put in as that is where I see the sftp/ preleading the ip address, so I could say it was lucky on my behalf that Filezilla does that.
So, what's the problem you're having?
Have you checked the spam folder? Do the emails and hosting fall under the same name servers?
I guess I don't know Wordpress enough, to know what's going to happen ahead of time for a computer illiterate client that I just installed a wordpress in their folder. I was also thinking about server updates, like messing around with iptables or whatever and I restart apache and suddenly all their webpages go down for a minute or so. Maybe I can send out a message.
What do you mean? What spam folder? I don't have any sort of mailing clients working. A redditor had informed me of how to use an office 365 email / smtp to have email that doesn't end up in spam.
D3js in this case.
Why not run the db on a server and not big down the client with js?
d3 is way overkill if he just wants to display table data. I'd go with datatables.net I've used it before and it's fairly easy to get up and running
Thanks. But that looks fancy. I just want a boring spreadsheet table. 
The db is on a server. But I need to show the tables/data inside on a web page. I need to visualize it like in Excel. Sorting columns, moving columns around, entering new data. Like a spread sheet.
DataTables.net
If you work at home, sure
If you've got another job or something during the day and need to control your own hours, either remote work for a company or freelance work through a platform like [Upwork \(formerly ODesk\)](https://www.upwork.com/) would fit the bill.
Remote work for a company in a different country maybe? I know we have some developers in Greece.
Sounds like something you may be doing if you're either on-call or in IT as a server admin for example. Also if you work remote and don't need to meet with others regularly, I suppose you're free to work whenever you want.
If my site expected to launch at night I would be there in the office at night. Also if a client called because their website was on fire, I'd respond, even at 4:30am. Otherwise the context of shifts doesn't make sense. You can throw more workers at a house and get it built quicker. That works for web sites too. We cann all work at the same time. 

Now if you are in order fulfillment at a web store that's different. Only so many people can work a warehouse at once
If you work at home and don't need to interact with anyone who works during the day*

Well, on your first codepen I'd recommend to remove the </script> tag at the end of your script.

Also, you're asking some strange things here. Is this just a CSS thing? Then please make just one codepen to illustrate the exact problem you're having. Codepen doesn't support PHP, and the way you just pasted the stuff you used elsewhere in your second codepen just makes things all the more confusing for us.
OK sorry for the confusion. I am attempting to have text that is submitted appear in a div on another page. I have linked the page with PHP and the text appears fine. My problem is the text will not stay within the div, the text leaves the div and is not bound to it. I want the div to re-size each time to the text submitted, to stay within the div at all times. I tried to do this by using 'display: inline-block;' but I can not seem to get it to work. The PHP code I am using is here:

<div id="phpCode">
  <div id="imageSquare">
  </div>
      <?php
          echo $_POST['t1'];
           echo "<br />";
           echo "<br />";
          echo 'Price: '.'â‚¬'.$_POST['t2'];
            echo "<br />";
            echo "<br />";
            echo htmlspecialchars($_POST['t3']);
            echo "<br />";

            ?>
</div>

 The CSS i am using with it is here:


        #phpCode {
          display: inline-block;
          position: relative;
          top: 200px;
          left:100px;
          background-color: #ff4d4d
;
          width: 300px;
          height: 500px;
          font-family: "Times New Roman", Times, serif;
          font-size: 25px;
          text-align: center;
        }

        #imageSquare {
          height: 200px;
          width:100px;
          width: 70%;
          margin:10px auto;
          position: relative;
          top:10px;

          border-color: black;
          background-color: black;

          }


Here is a codepen of the page with the div I am trying to fix: 

http://codepen.io/anon/pen/LGLPQK


Is that more clear? Sorry for the confusion.

You have words that are wider than the container they're being displayed in. If you don't want that to happen, you can:

* make the container wider/flexible (like remove the width from #phpCode)
* make the font smaller or use less words/characters
* cause a word-break anywhere in the word via `word-break: break-all;`
"Platform as a Service" and "Other web product" under "Run a startup" -> "Web" should have the same follow up questions. I was not expecting Java immediately after selecting "Platform as a Service"

Great! I only know one language decently and decided to take this quiz. Got fucking python, which I already know ...
Well, knock me over with a feather. Java.    ^I'm^a^.NET^dev.

Is there .NET in here... anywhere?
No Perl?
Arguably Objective-C is still the safe choice for IOS development. Swift is not very well proven, and evolving quite drastically. Most code examples and conversations around IOS still take place in Objective-C. You could fit both Swift and Objective-C into your decision tree with more options I'm sure. The hipsters here are going to swear by Swift, but let's forget about 'cool' and be realistic about this one; Swift isn't 100% there yet.

I hate that Java still exists, can't wait for that to die off.

When it comes to AI there's a lot of subcategories where C++ should be present. This is actually a complicated area where a few different languages play a role depending on nature of the problem.

I don't see categories for engineering, computational physics, analytics, operating systems, system administration, etc.

It would be nice if you didn't say "Language X is what you use for this", but maybe instead "Language X is the most commonly used for this, and Language Y and Z are sometimes also used."

There's a good bit of room for improvement.

Not a bad start.
This is great! :D Really well made! It would be cool to see the whole decision tree too

We shouldn't be complaining about any tech chain/stack.

If you use something it didn't recommend, GOOD. That thing probably works for you, keep using it.

For real though, this all seems accurate as of like 5 years ago. Times have changed a little since then.

Had a good laugh! ^I^hate^you^Outlook
Nice little idea. I've got two suggestions:

1) There are syntax errors in the Python code (missing : at the end of if/else instructions).

2) If someone chooses the syntax of PHP when presented Python and Ruby as alternatives, you should point them to [this website](http://www.essilor.com/en/EyeHealth/LensesForYourVision/TestyourEyes/Pages/home.aspx).
The website preserving the history of each page is a bit frustrating. I have tried multiple things and had to press back button multiple times to get here again. Not that Im lazy to type the address but it seems a bit overkill. 
interesting, but odd that the default language when I go to that age is JavaScript. when that shouldn't be the answer to ANYTHING. no seriously. it's shit. fo real. fuck JavaScript.
You can always learn more python.
I got this too...I have no intention of moving from .NET to java...does it even consider. Net
.NET is not a language though. You can get C# by going to professional -> Desktop -> Windows, for example.
There is if you go Web => professional
I got there by be a pro => web => logic => enterprise => like the language
professional -> desktop -> windows
What about Lucee?  It recommended Java.  Is Lucee close enough?
Have you played around with Swift much.
I did a small project with it, and it is a really awesome language; I really love how it handles null with packing/unpacking variables.
One can select PHP just because it looks more familiar, more C-like. When I looked at some ruby code for the first time in my life it was confusing because it was hard to tell elements apart (e.g. what's function, what's argument and etc.). I love the way ruby code looks now when I understand what's what.

I don't think that the way the syntax looks at first glance can be considered as a criteria to pick a programming language.
oh how smug.

>I've been a PHP dev for 10 years

Those living in glass houses... 


I wasn't sure whether do downvote you for your poor grammar, or for shitting on a language without justification, but I downvoted you anyway.
Funny, i can't get it to stop saying PHP
    import python
I got C# so it's definitely in there.
That would be ColdFusion/CFML, right? I don't see why that wouldn't be an option, but then again I didn't write it.
Enough to know it's cool, and enough not to use it for any large projects just yet.
Idk. I enjoy writing js much more than python specifically because of the syntax 
I learned C around the same time as PHP, and love my semicolons  and braces. Nowdays I pretty much exclusively use Node/R/PHP, but at one point I did a lot of C and Java. 
Depending on your coding style, every language can look awful.
Hahaha, fucking rekt.
PHP and Node Developer here, I got a laugh, thanks. 
They said first glance. For example, when I first saw Clojure, I had no idea I would eventually love its syntax, so it would have been a bad idea to rule it out based on syntax alone.
I see you enjoy money and productivity.

I'm so so sorry...
Don't be, it lets me work 20h a week and travel for a few months out of the year. Pretty happy with that. 
That is a very clean looking way to develop expressions. I feel like it's kind of overkill in production, but I think it would help a lot in creating them.
This is my kind of library. Regex has been my main gripe as a programmer. My brain just doesn't work that way. 

This gives it an Active Record kinda feel.
/u/thelonepuffin Moreover, it makes your code more readable. Problem with writing Regex is readability. Regex are the least readable objects I have seen. They are difficult to understand in first look.
It depends on your client's preference. If client is okay with customizing a pre-built theme, then you can go ahead.
[deleted]
All depends on the client's budget for me. If they're willing to pay for a bespoke theme they get one, if they've got a limited budget they get pre-built.
Definitely depends on the budget and client's needs. 

If you do use a pre-built WooCommerce theme, I strongly recommend starting with something like the Storefront theme from WooThemes, and then making a Child Theme. 

When updates for StoreFront / WooComm are released, you can safely update the WooCommerce Plugin as well as Storefront. You won't have to worry if your theme works with the new WooComm version. 

If I'm building a regular WP theme(NOT ecommerce), I prefer underscores.me and making my own theme, but for WC I use child themes

Depends on the client and the budget. For some projects, starting with a barebones theme is almost mandatory (e-commerce) as there are so many different bases that need to be covered.
If you're not going to design it then just point your client to a list of themes and see if there's something they like.

No?

Then charge extra and customize a design for them and then customize a theme.

Otherwise if they find a theme they like, use it and build a child-theme. They don't care as long as they can transport it etc.
Thanks for your response! 

So then it would just a matter of being up front with the client, making sure that they know that you're customizing a theme vs building a new one. 

Ethics!
Seems legit! Thanks for your response! 

You will get clients who don't care about the details and want something that 'just works'. The other thing about Wordpress is that it's relatively user-friendly (as opposed to building something from scratch - you may understand how it works, but will your client?).

Budget is definitely the other factor - if it's a little limited then you'll want something that you can setup pretty quickly and save you a ton of time.
The implementation you're looking for is called [OAuth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth).
That's the flow I'm using 
I just implemented OAuth on a project two weeks ago - urgh.

Udacity actually has an OAuth implementation mini-course -- definitely helped me wrap my head around it:

https://www.udacity.com/course/authentication-authorization-oauth--ud330
Could you be a little more descriptive please? I'm aware of OAuth and am instead using JWT based auth on my side.
You want to build an API, basically.

Start your research there, since we don't know what tools you have available.
Github Pages if it's a simple static site. It even comes with a free domain name (username.github.io). 
I use a DigitalOcean droplet for VPS (hosting solution), and NameCheap for domain names. There's probably better things to do but it works for me.
I develop myself almost entirely on cloud9, where you can also host sites, you should check it out! It's free to use and easy to start with. Just pick that you want apache, php and mysql, and you are more than ready to host your sites.
I use the same, no complaints.
Template ? :)
It reduces the number of page redraws by batching multiple DOM changes into one place - that is the requestAnimationFrame function.

> The Window.requestAnimationFrame() method tells the browser that you wish to perform an animation and requests that the browser call a specified function to update an animation before the next repaint.
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window/requestAnimationFrame

i.e. the library queues all functions you pass to fastdom.mutate. then it calls requestAnimationFrame with it's own "queue execution" function and performs all the queued DOM changes. The browser hoever waits until the "queue execution" function is done before redrawing the website instead of redrawing it on each single DOM change.
I recommend spending a day with each, as well as Foundation 6, Materialize and something simple like Skeleton or PureCSS.

I've tried them all but I realised it's actually not that difficult to make the components in React anyway, and I get to avoid trying to override styling and keep 500kB libraries out of my code. Also, I have NO layout specified in my HTML, which is nice. Lost Grid helps with that.

I do use Normalize.CSS.
I like semantic over bootstrap but if you have the time I definitely recommend using a barebones grid framework or even just using flexbox and doing all your own styling.

Probably the reason I prefer semantic over bootstrap is I find the javascript hooks easier to use with React or other component frameworks.
Would love to see the replies to this. 
Build a bunch of sites for local businesses, make some hobby sites, make a list of goals that are just beyond your reach and hit them all, deal with as many web-based technologies as you can. That's how I started in the '90s and I'm still doing it today. I've had web development books published, and worked on big sites like ba.com and apple.com, so don't think self-taught people can't make it. Just keep at it, focus, constantly push yourself, and surround yourself with people who are much smarter than you. Get things up on Github, contribute, get your resume/CV looking good, and then start applying for jobs. It might take a while, but it's not an unattainable goal, so don't feel you can't do this â€“ you can. 
hi! I was in your position as well, except without any education to hate in the first place. Working a $20K CDN a year job on the phones for a junk removal company.  
  
I started teaching myself in August 2014 and in December 2014, I was employed as a jr full-stack dev. It's now Jan 2016 and I'm lead developer and got to hire my own team under me.  
  
I really think self study is the way to do this, and there has literally never been a better time to do it. Jobs are in demand and the resources available on the internet are thorough and lack absolutely nothing to get you employed.  
  
Here's my basic outline of what I did, if you have ANY other questions, please respond or message me and I'll answer any the best I can. I love to get other people started on a debt free, high paying, incredibly fun position.  
  
I learned html/css/js/php/mysql all vanilla on their own. Used Codecademy, finished all the relevant tracks on there within the first week [HTML & CSS, Javascript, jQuery, YouTube API, PHP, and also played with the Python one just to see what another back end language looked like], and bought Jon Duckett's HTML/CSS and JS/jQuery books. i read these in a week and did all the examples and customized stuff til i had broken it beyond use.  
  
I can't say how important using Jon Duckett's books were. They are so fucking thorough and so fun to read, beautifully designed, that I think he succeeded in tricking me into learning without realizing it. I was actually addicted to these books. Get them, and do the examples. You say you have intermediate HTML/CSS, but I do believe that practicing these EVERY DAY is one hundred percent necessary before being employed. Up to the day of employment, write code. You need to live and breathe this shit, and when I hire people who have no experience [which I have done twice], this is what I look for, and it's easy to tell someone who has passing familiarity with HTML/CSS over the years, or someone who has written 200 lines of it every day for 3 months. These books are great for that. You need to be so comfortable with HTML/CSS that integrating it into the actual programming langauges [JS/PHP] doesn't require any thought.

i used lynda.com with Kevin Skoglund's courses on PHP/MySQL. i did both of his courses, and then felt comfortable building an auth system in PHP, and an emailer, and things like that. i highly recommend them, the man teaches so damn well even if you know nothing, and doesn't make you feel like an idiot. Kevin Skoglund is single handedly responsible for making me understand PHP instead of just a framework/CMS. I really get it now. He teaches so slowly but comfortably that, by the end of the second course, I had a really great understanding of how objects, sessions, authentication, encrypting, etc, all work in PHP, and when I started it I had literally no understanding of any of those things.
  
then i tried several php frameworks out, learned development standards like git/vagrant/gulp [google all of these if you don't know what they are, you need them], and dabbled in ruby. i decided laravel was my favorite, so i went full steam in to that, learning SASS at the same time.  

then i made the things on my portfolio. which were a URL shortener, a 'classifieds' site for Smash Bros players wanting to play online, and a website that displays a random home-made joke of mine. then i felt that was enough. I applied for jobs and got one within several hours, actually from reddit/r/forhire. Hah.  
  
The most important thing is to show you are passionate and that will come out in talking about coding, whether you know whatever the interviewer is talking about or not. If you have dabbled a bit over the years, there will be another guy interviewing for that position who only started recently, but he has been living in the code, and he will get that position. Be sharp, be on point, always be willing to admit what you don't know. Developing is more about your ability to solve a problem than having memorized solutions to problems you've already solved.  
  

  
edit: should say that in between every resource I listed, I was always reading reddit/r/webdev, stackoverflow, coding blogs, etc. Just taking it all in. It's important to know the things out there that you're NOT using, as well. Not knowing how to use them, but just knowing something like "I should use Node.js because it excels in this kind of application, and PHP for this one" is handy and goes a long way to showing you're present with modern web dev stuff.
  
edit2: shit, i forgot Laracasts. Jeffrey Way is the single most important person during my self-study. he made me a better and happier programmer. i've watched about 80 Laracasts videos and continue to do so. there is a Laracast for anything. It's a tutorial website for the PHP framework Laravel, and there is no better introduction to coding in a modern framework than this. You also become significantly better at PHP, Javascript, using your IDE [ text editor], command line, code security, etc. Invaluable.
Let me put a slight disclaimer right from the off - I am not an employer, and I only have around eight months experience as a web developer myself. But, I was also in the position of having to start from the bottom in web development, and now having found employment I think I'm in a pretty good position to be able to give advice having recently gone through the process myself. I have also had the advantage of speaking with my boss immediately after he has interviewed several other potential candidates that he's been trying to recruit for another position, so I know first hand what it is he's looking for (other employers may of course vary - but I can only relate to my personal experience with him).

Look at this from a potential employer's perspective. All they would know at this point is that you would probably be a good bet for a lawyer position, but I'm willing to gamble that's probably not what they're looking for right now. It's all very well showing up to an interview and saying "Hey! I'm really, really interested in web development - you should definitely hire me because I'll be great!", but you can appreciate that this would be a huge leap of faith for them to employ you purely based off that. So, how do you get around this?

Create a portfolio website. Get working on things (anything) and get them on your portfolio website and on Github. Demonstrate your interest and your skills to the employer - prove to them just how enthusiastic about web development you really are. There have been at least five interviewees where literally all my boss has said is "go away, actually create something, come back and show me and THEN we can talk". He wants to see their drive and determination just as much (if not more so) than what they can actually do in terms of web development. For him, enthusiasm and willingness to learn is everything. I genuinely believe if any one of them had actually gone away and done just that, and come back to him and proved how much they're worth - they would be sat on the desk beside me at work by now.

As an example, let me share something that went hugely in my favour when I went for my interview. Having checked out the company's website beforehand (another tip - do your research), I noticed it wasn't responsive. Before the interview I knocked up an exact copy (design wise) of the homepage - but just a mobile version of it. In the interview I whipped it out and showed him and he was very impressed. Having shown that initiative went massively in my favour and I luckily got the job.

I've written a blog post about how to become a web developer here: http://www.luketwomey.com/blog/how-to-become-a-web-developer most of it you've already got covered in terms of having learnt your skills already etc, but you may find it an interesting read none-the-less.

Hope I've helped in some way, if you would like to know anything else then please do let me know.
I'm considering the same type of career change. I studied to be an Electrical Engineer but after three years of working for a bloated enterprise, I'm about ready to start over in a different direction.

I've been playing around with all the major "learn yourself to code" services available  for a while and have landed on one called freeCodeCamp. It's slightly different from Udacity or Codecademy but its focus is more on learning the coding basics and then applying them to creating increasingly complex websites, while continuing to increase your depth of knowledge in the various areas. It also focuses its curriculum on a JavaScript stack (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, AngularJS, Node.js, MongoDB, etc.).

The most attractive reason to stay motivated and complete their curriculum is the long list of required websites you'd have completed by the end and the community that seems to be continually growing and helping students to find jobs.

I'd highly recommend you give it a try.
Especially since you're already in Denver, you should at least check out Turing School of Software & Design. I'm going there now and it's full of people in your situation. It's 7 months long, as opposed to 3 months or so like the bootcamps. I considered programs all over the country, including CS degree programs, and Turing was by far my top choice.  Just look into it, let me  know if you have any questions. 

edit - If you feel that you can accomplish your goals purely through self-study, then great. But if you want more structure and a community to work with, then ^^
Thanks so much!

Do you think it's worth applying to a bootcamp (like RefactorU)?

How would you recommend targeting/approaching businesses? Go through a phone book and find small business's without a web presence, or try and find places that have really bad sites and approach them?
Thanks a bunch!

What would you suggest as the baseline level of skill where I could be comfortable interviewing for a entry-level position without embarrassing myself? 

My working plan at this point is to spend the next few months starting from scratch so I can make sure I have a solid foundation (since honestly my knowledge to this point has been gathered over the past 8 years with little organization... so there are a lot of holes) and then try my hand at developing a couple full sites (I have connections with a few local non-profits with horrendous sites that I'm sure would let me redesign for free) and then look into applying for jobs in August/September. Do you think that is a realistic plan? Or should I be targeting a longer period of learning?

Do you think attending a bootcamp (like RefactorU) is worth it?

I'll PM you if I can think of any more questions.
Sure, RefactorU looks okay. 

Go with your own suggestions there, plus what LukeTwomey said about converting sites to be responsive. That's something that a lot of people will need doing, so the more experience you have at that, the better. 
Just a heads up Udemy courses are almost always at a very large "discount", I don't believe I've ever actually seen a course through them run full price. I wouldn't go out and buy a bunch of them based on the discount alone.

That said I've bought a few bundles where it was something like 10 courses for $20 and I can't say I've actually used any of them. I personally go for subscription based sites like [Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/), [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com/), [Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com/), and [Lynda](http://www.lynda.com/). Those are some of the more popular ones at least.
I would say the only course I found worth buying on Udemy was Anthony Alicea's: JS the Weird Parts. However, I would hold off on watching it as a beginner. Once you get more experience then I'd move onto his course. It deals with more intermediate/advanced concepts that will make more sense after having a good understanding of the main fundamentals. 

I would recommend TTH. I used that and found it was really good. However, I have hit a point where I don't watch many tutorials much anymore. I just build stuff and google/ask for help with problems. I also have shifted more to reading programming books too.

I would say pick up a TTH (or any sub website, whatever you prefer), John Ducketts JS and jQuery front end book, and start reading/watching and implementing what you're learning. As you start getting more and more experience, and more comfortable with your skills, start looking into intermediate/advanced concepts such as higher-order functions, closures, callbacks, anonymous functions, and even start looking into data structures and algorithms.

Just take the learning process slow and don't rush it! Good luck.

PS. Packtpub has $5 books. I picked up their functional programming and algorithms/data structure books. Both are great!
+1 for Laracasts if you are interested in Laravel dev.
Those self-assed "meters" of your skill level are hogwash. I've interviewed people who put "expert" at certain skills, and when asked basic questions they should have been able to answer, they failed.

The best approach is this:

1. Enumerate the technologies you've *actually* worked with and built things with (not what you dabbled in for an hour)
2. Give **actual** examples of HOW you used those technologies
3. Similar to #2, list problems you've solved and how you've solved them/what you solved them with.

> "Used React to build a contact form with cascading select options, and obtained server-side validation via AJAX requests."

That one sentence tells me a few things:

1. That you've used React
2. That you've solved a real-world problem with React
3. That you know AJAX
4. That you know client-side validation alone is insufficient
5. That you likely care about UX

Tell me what's in the guys of asp.net
Don't do the meters crap. I would self assess as upper mid level in a lot of things I know far beyond most people because I know enough to know what I don't know. The meters are junk. 

If you have a traditional resume with one page, tune it to the position you are applying for and focus on talking about how you've used a few key technologies. Then have a pretty comprehensive list of key technologies somewhere. This provides real insight into what you've built and discussion points for things you used in lesser amounts.
> Those self-assed "meters" of your skill level are hogwash.

Thanks. I thought so as well.

> I've interviewed people who put "expert" at certain skills, and when asked basic questions they should have been able to answer, they failed.

I keep hearing this sort of thing (Jeff Atwood's old blog entry comes to mind...) and it's f-ing spectacular. I can't believe people still do this in disciplines where is so provable when you can't carry your weight.

Anyways, thanks for giving a real-world example from your interviewing experience. Good to know that I'm on the right track.

I'm thinking of placing about 2-5 statements next to each category briefly explaining what I've done in that space.

For example; Although I don't know React, I do know Angular. I think I'd want to point out that I've used routing to build a SPA, factored commonly used idioms in to services to stay DRY, and applied data binding, nested controllers, directives etc to de-jQuery my pages and get the DOM out of my code-behind. In other words I didn't just read a `Learn Angular in 1 hour or less` and try to make a hack job.


Sadness and some Steve Balmer juice.
S3 has a rest api.
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/APIRest.html
You can purchase the domain [here](https://www.namecheap.com/domains/registration/results.aspx?domain=KingOfWhales.com), it's presently available (though might not be for long now that people know you want it).
It's called a domain. So you want to buy a domain.
>I do, however, want to learn how to do it "the right way" and use a database.

Fine.

>I've tried MySQL, SQLite, and MongoDB and they are all way too complicated for me to actually learn and use, especially when my JSON system works just fine

MySQL and SQLite are relational database management systems. MongoDB is noSQL (which I wouldn't recommend for your usage case). So it's `way too complicated` for you to learn? You're ignorant! SQL is easy. `SELECT * FROM users;` fetches all the existing users. `INSERT INTO users (username, email) VALUES ('thefeeltrain', 'thefeeltrain@gmail.com');` creates a new user. What do you want? You firstly stated that you want to learn it the right way and then you say that you don't want to.

A relational database is made for keeping relations valid. What happens if a post someone liked gets deleted? You would have to loop through all the `liked_posts` arrays of all users and remove the id if it is present. SQL would do this automatically if you specified `ON DELETE CASCADE` once. 

>Even though I'm sure it's a huge security risk

Why should it be? Are the files publicly accessible? If not it of course depends on your validations.

I think you should firstly learn and understand SQL before using an ORM.


Are you familiar with the idea of an ORM and/or DAO, or things like the Active Record pattern? They are constructs designed to make managing persisted data relatively simple.

While I don't practice php, I suggest you look into these as they might make the bits you were finding difficult much easier.

You'll still need to set up a database (my personal fav is postgresql)
Sounds like you want an ORM (Propel, Eloquent, Doctrine, etc) which abstracts everything into a nice API... Then you can pick whatever database you'd rather use.. I'm not even going to address the JSON thing you are doing.
>Even though I'm sure it's a huge security risk

Security is probably not your problem. Keeping those queries working with more than a few users will be the problem.
I would suggest using [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) as a good solution to the problems you're encountering. It's extremely simple to use due to it's clear documentation and reasonably large community. 

It comes with a basic authentication system built in and the [Eloquent ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/5.0/eloquent) is extremely easy to use without having to write any database queries at all.
As others have said, get an ORM.

I haven't had to touch SQL in ages. Writing substantial SQL statements is an exercise in frustration.
~~MySQL. PHP has support for it built in. It takes 5 minutes to download WAMP and set up a quick server for yourself, and that includes PHP and SQL. Just go on `localhost/phpmyadmin`, login with username "root" (no password), create a user, create a database, create a table, and then just link to it in PHP. I learned how it works on the W3Schools website with a bit of Googling.~~

Read your post again, seems I missed a lot. I still recommend MySQL, but I recommend that you use a Rails (or similar - Django and Node are alternatives, but a little harder to learn) backend to get the data from the database and to the user.
Google AdWords is what you're probably looking for.

This morning they asked me if I had recently been foraging for truffles...
Like two years ago when Opinion Rewards came out I used to get 2-3 per week. Eventually like a year ago they just stopped. I haven't had a single survey available in about a year. Every single time I open the app it says "No survey at this time"

EDIT: here's a screenshot of my survey history: http://i.imgur.com/54gE5My.jpeg
They're essentially testing you; trying to make sure you're not just picking random answers to questions.
Inb4 you get a job at Google lol.
HAH! I got a very similar one today... 
aurelia.io 
I got that too! Probably one of the weirdest questions. 
I really wouldn't be surprised if that's one of the questions they ask to see if you're telling the truth on surveys. I got it a few months back. 
you're just not interesting
do you have your location services enabled? do you commute often?
Dang, my first full year I banked $40. My gf got almost $60. She gets a lot more surveys than me. 

I can almost always predict when I'll get a location based survey though. Swing by any CVS, Best Buy or Home Depot. Those always pop up for me within 2 days. 
You may have accidentally chosen a nonsense or made up answer that was intentionally put there to test your honesty. Happened to a couple of people on r/android.
Try uninstalling it and reinstalling it? Or did you already do this?
Yeah, they'll even throw in stores/locations that don't even exist to make sure you don't say you've recently visited them. Some jerk whose name is Me learned the hard way and never got many surveys after that.
How, though? Technically AngularJS is a "thing" that can interest you.

I go all over town all the time. On top of that I always fill out reviews for places I go to. Google has all my search history too. I can't imagine they have nothing to ask my opinion on lol.

Location services is also enabled. 
I did. Along with clearing all the app data and trying to start again from scratch. No-go. 
That's why they throw it in.  Google know you like angular so it'd make you suspicious if you don't select it
AngularJS is the control. They expect OP to pick it.
Have you ever lied?
Ahh, I understand now! 

What if you lose interest in it? :D
Quite the contrary. I think I might have been too honest. 
I found they sometimes throw questions that have some made up answers to see if you're lying.
I've seen repeat questions with the answers jumbled up a few times too.
You can use a function for parcing the int values since it's used multiple times. Other suggestions:  use else if for the gender(still calculates to 0 if not m or f). Maybe use the results to show what input is not valid. Overall, it works well just some dummy proofing and UX improvements needed.

https://www.digitalocean.com/pricing/ (a name you'll hear recommended a lot) has a great $5/mo offering. That's $60/year. Comes with 512mb, so you should be able to fit multiple apps on it. If your app needs a database, you can certainly fit an app + its database on the same machine.

And, of course, if your site doesn't actually need an application server because it's just some static HTML/JS, then https://pages.github.com/ is free.
You can get a low power VPS for around $1.25 per month.

http://adminhacks.com/vps-compare.html

I run a small static site on the ramnode $1.25 plan. I get about 1000 pageviews a day and the load is just fine.
[heroku](https://www.heroku.com/pricing) is a good alternative if you dont want to spend money for development purposes. I prefer digital ocean as ive had a good customer service from them and the pricing is not that bad either for what you get.
To expound on your second point, if it is only static HTML, you can do S3 for free/pennies.

GitHub pages are free but they're generally for websites explaining the features/documentation for the open source project hosted on Github.

If you're not making at least a "free" version publicly available on Github, I would advise against it.

Just use Amazon S3. You'd almost certainly fall within the free tier. http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/website-hosting-custom-domain-walkthrough.html
aws has a funny way of charging me when I use their free tier.  It is usually like 20 cents so I never bother complaining to them.
> *The AWS free usage tier will expire 12 months from the date you sign up.*

When did you sign up? You're probably just paying full price. Full price based on your usage is probably $0.20
Your header image is too big (5400x3600), it takes too long to load. You should downsize it to 1920px width, or 3840px if you still want it to fill out a 4k hd display.
Not bad.  Works good responsively.  I personally would like to see some color and less grey scales.  Maybe a white background, and pick a light color background for your block links.  Or throw in some red highlights with what you have and you'll have a kind of Captain America color theme going.  Glad there's no pictures of people doing a handshake.  
Viewing on an android, I'm impressed. It's pretty, responsive and ungaudy. How did you approach it?
On LTE it took 5 seconds to load. Dynamically decide by the width of the screen on different resolutions to load
Thanks for the feedback I appreciate the reply!

Colour is something I find hard to get right which is why it's quite monotone. I figured you can't make a monochromatic scheme look bad but I guess it is kind of boring. I'll work on it! Would you say as a rule a white background is better than a light grey?
I used bootstrap and a flat ui bootstrap pack so to be fair that saved me a lot of work.

Then I just organised all my elements on the bootstrap grid and added any media queries I felt I needed. The only bit that was a little more interesting are the boxes that expand to reveal the problems and the solution buttons which I coded myself :)

Will do thanks for the tip
The white background versus grey depends.  I think for your site, I would do a white body, or the blocks having a white background.  Look at some Youtube pages for example - light grey bg and white bg on the sections.  I like the Material Design themes too with white backgrounds and then a second main color.  Play a bit with your colors.  I, personally, don't always go with my first thought.  I usually do at least three variations.  As you finish up your site, you'll probably tune the colors anyway which is normal.  Maybe check out sites like dribbble.com and wrapbootstrap.com for some ideas too.  Again, there's nothing wrong with your site.
Coolers.com. thnk me later
Also, compress images in quality for better result. www.compressor.io is a really great tool for that.
Looks like a cool tool. Thanks
Learn to use Git and GitHub. It will save your bacon the next time. Brackets works great with Git. 
check your trash
Search around and see if you've accidentally moved the folder/files somewhere else, I've managed to do that before and it's a right pain.

Also, as has been mentioned, learn how to use git and github/bitbucket. It's a very useful skill.

Also, why is your teacher forcing you to use a specific text editor? That's just stupid.
already done... if would not have checked almost everything i would not post it here.
  
to be honest what is gone is gone, it is just a week of work that i now need to do in one day. and if i stay at school depends of that website.
  
the point is to know if brackets will do this again, to just never use it again.
I've only used brackets briefly, but when i did, the UI was flakey. I don't trust that program. Check your shit into version control and push it off your computer regularly.

Also, your teacher shouldn't care what program you use. If he does, he's a dumbass.
Teacher's fault. Put all the blame on them if you don't get it done. And fuck his Brackets-only rule, use Atom or Sublime 3 or something.

Cool thanks - I figured something like this existed...
Depends on what the contract said. Most likely it belongs to the client.
In the absence of a contract transferring copyright, it is retained by the creator/designer. Based on what you said this is likely the case. I am not a lawyer and not giving legal advice BUT the expense of pursuing damages for copyright infringement would likely be sufficient enough that someone who isn't sophisticated enough to utilize contracts probably wouldn't have the sophistication or resources to pursue a legal remedy. 
It *should* be the businesses. If they paid for it or completed the deal with the deisgner. If the designer did not transfer copyright that is a technicality, and frankly a professional mistake on the designer's part, that can be remedied and likely ignored. If the business did not pay for it or complete the deal with the designer than you may have more issues because the designer would likely try to protect copying. In the end they would have to sue, but can make things difficult.

Basicalky, if the business is on the up and up in relation to the work then you should be OK. If the site was deleted because they didn't pay the original designer then you have issues.
Quick question: have you checked archival sites and Google cache? If one of them contains it you can just get the old source back that way!
Read that HTML. Is the whole thing by chance just someone elses theme? That would make it easy.
It's just a small company, a simple webpage. So no contracts.
That would be super helpful. I tried [googlecache.com](https://www.google.com/?gws_rd=ssl), but it may possibly be, I have no idea what I'm doing.
Then whoever originally made it. Copyright doesn't pass along just because you paid someone else to work on something.
http://cachedview.com/ seems to give results from all caching services I know of myself. So throw the URL in there and with a bit of luck one of them cached/archived it. 
I think that it doesn't have personality.
It is structured like every other site on the Internet: sections big as the screen, useless first section, no creativity.
Nothing different from the rest. That's all.

Obviously, it is my humble (and maybe stupid for someone) opinion.

Sorry for my English, but I'm not a native speaker. :c
Your header's font's vs the background have pretty bad contrast. [Not legible at all, the contrast needs to be higher.](http://i.imgur.com/ZNGtDQu.png) Look at it in [monochrome- you can't even see it!](http://i.imgur.com/lv1IwAA.png)


[Your header seems to be awkwardly spaced.](http://i.imgur.com/OLEt2oS.png) Increase the bottom padding, and either increase the font size or decrease the heading height. Try that and see if it looks better.

I think a lot of elements on your page lack proper spacing/margin/padding/whitespace. This section is a [great example of this](http://i.imgur.com/O8WzMcp.png) The icons are smushed together, theres no bottom padding in the section, the top padding of the section is too little.

Your work section thumbnails are also strangely spaced- On one hand you have a solid 140px between thumbnails horizontally, but only like 4px between them vertically? Just doesn't make sense IMO.

I personally am not a fan of the oval for your About section. Also, why not just vertically center the paragraph on the right hand side? There's an imbalance of whitespace IMO- a lot on the bottom and very little on the top.

Hope that helps. A TL;DR: your spacing needs improvement
Hey thanks for the long critique definitely helps out. I'll work on the spacing of everything to give it more aesthetics and make it visually appealing. 
Hey no problem. When visiting other well-designed websites, usually those with big names, try to pay attention to whitespace and how they use it. For content to be balanced it needs breathing room. Good luck!
I'll keep that in mind, definitely some great advice!
I found learning Angular 2 to be easier than learning React, coming from extensive 1.0 knowledge. So either 1.x & 2.x share similar paradigms, or React is vastly more complex than the others. Being safe and saying it's actually the former, I'd recommend learning 1.x before 2x, simply because it'll be valuable getting jobs you land on the upgrade path 
> I guess Angular 2 would be more useful in the future, but worried as to how stable it is

It's in beta. The team behind it believes that the framework is suitable for use in production. There shouldn't be huge breaking changes from now on, but there's still a risk.

> There would be a ton more tutorials for Angular 1, so learning 2 would be a steeper learning curve?

There's plenty more ressource for Angular 1. Ressources for Angular 2 are coming, though. From my point of view, Ng1 was overly complicated and Ng2 is much more simpler. 

> Advice is needed & welcome :)

Job-wise, Angular 1 would be better. It powers a TON of apps out there, so the skill is and will continue to be relevant for a while. Now, wether Angular 2 will be as popular is anyone's guess.

For any other reason, use Angular2. It's better on every aspect.
Is there any reason you need stability for a portfolio project? I'd use 2 for a small project personally, it's more interesting and there's not as many opportunities to use it right now. I don't think it'll make any difference to your resume, a good hiring manager knows that these skills are fungible.
Right now, unless you know Typescript already, there is a MASSIVE difference between Angular 1 and Angular 2, because Angular 2's dev team is prioritizing documentation in Typescript. The JS version of the documentation is kind of.... shitty.... right now (and I suspect it will remain shitty).

So not only would you need to learn Angular 2 itself, you would have to learn Typescript as well, including what build processes are involved with Typescript. Your typical gulp/browserify/webpack process will be different.

What's ironic is if Angular is attempting to "compete" with React + Flux + Redux, it's focus on Typescript will help it lose. Javascript (especially functional javascript) is a great language/paradigm for the relatively simple stuff 99% of web applications need. You simply don't NEED all that strict typing and OO bullshit for most apps, unless you are trying to build something closer to a desktop-caliber application using Angular (which appears to be what A2 is aiming towards.

    import {bootstrap}    from 'angular2/platform/browser'

Apparently browser-based apps are only *one* of the things A2 is aiming towards, meaning it's trying to position itself as more than just a typical website / webapp framework, which means sacrificing simplicity for any one use-case while trying to handle many use-cases (none of this is surprising considering Microsoft has been a major contributor to A2)

This lack of focus and lack of transferrable JS skills is going to turn a lot of JS devs towards React and other JS + web-oriented frameworks and libraries, which will increase their relative demand, which will increase their demand in the job market.

That's not to say there won't be good paying jobs for A2 when it stabilizes and matures, simply because those jobs will tend to be more in enterprise development. But, I suspect the job market for A2 will be smaller than A1 because mass adoption of A2 probably won't happen the same way it did with A1.
I'd learn React instead. It really seems like that is going to win out in these front end app "frameworks"
Angular 2. 1 will be heading into the sunset sooner rather than later. Unless you are developing something for a client, in which case you should avoid beta products as a rule, you may as well learn the latest and greatest on the Angular line. 

That said, learn you some React, too! Sentiment these days is pretty pro React and it's my feeling (as someone who has built projects in Angular 1) that this trend is more than simple fanboy-ism.
https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/3y6mhz/how_is_angular_2/
I would use Angular 2 for personal projects, but for a big app or MVP that you want to be production ready soon, Angular 1 would probably be more appropriate.
neither
I mean get real. The question is today or tomorrow. Or more realistically, yesterday or today. Angular 2.0 is released. Disregard allegiances, if you know neither learn the evolution from te beginning. You might lose out short term. Whoops. Laugh at the ponies later.
I didn't get that at all. I tried out Angular in a side project for ~12 hours and React for ~6 hours and at the end of that I felt more comfortable bringing React into my real work than Angular -- and not just because it's a large existing application. I actually felt more confident that with React, whatever its challenges might be, I would never paint myself into a corner.

React feels like an awesome tool you can put in your toolbox to use when you want. Angular feels more like a cult you can either join or run away from. It might be a great way of life, but I'm scared of commitment.
Is there really such a fragmented job market around which exact js framework you have experience with?

If I've learned to work with angular 1, I wouldn't hesitate to apply for a job at a company that uses angular 2, or react, or plain old jquery, or any other. I feel like I could take a weekend to learn the basics of {new to me framework} and be productive on day 1.

Is that being arrogant?
Why? 
First off...."learn React" is not an answer to his question about Angular, you knob. 

Secondly, No single framework is going to "win out". Right now Angular is a more popular and widely used framework than React. There are tons of angular jobs. That being said, it doesn't matter, they are both awesome, they both do the same shit, and they are both here to stay.
Angular and react aren't even really comparable since react is just the "view" in MVC. In fact, you can use React in conjunction with Angular.

But yeah React is really buzzing right now so obviously this will be the top comment.
I would try out both, understand their strengths/weaknesses, and then pick the one best suited for whatever project you're going to be working on.  Neither React or Angular 1|2 will be the best tool for the job 100% of the time as you have to take into account not only a project's goals/requirements but also the skill set of the team.
why is frameworks in quotations
May I ask what is so bad about Angular?
I think React's "render" method is super slick, but I really enjoy Angular's dependency injection.
I think you're comparing react with angular 1, whereas they were comparing it to angular 2 which is supposed to be considerably simpler then 1.
Experienced devs can probably get ramped up sooner, but for people just starting out learning JS and feeling comfortable enough with the problem spaces that frameworks solve to jump into a framework, they won't be jumping into a framework that uses what is effectively a different language when they only just started getting the hang of a language they can use their browser as a simple repl for.

As such, newer devs will stick with JS frameworks, which means there will be a greater supply of those devs, which means easier and cheaper hiring options for companies, which may tip the decision in favor of using JS-oriented frameworks to build their solutions on instead of TS-oriented A2.
React is more lightweight, and less opinionated. Design-wise angular templates allow embedding control elements like <ng-repeat> in html. React works the other way - to allow embedding html-like jsx in javascript. Angular feels a lot like using xslt to manipulate xml in that respect. While in React you use more composible programming-language constructs - map, filter fold to create renderable elements. 

The flux/redux based React backends are also nice - forward-reverse debugging, no mutation, isomorphic rendering.
React is more libraryish than frameworky.
Ask google why they dropped it in it's entirety.
for starters, angular 1 and angular 2 arent even the same thing. They only share a name. So that's dumb.
What does angular's DI get you that es2015 modules don't?
Many larger than startup companies like opinionated frameworks because it's easier to onboard. As for control elements in html, there really isn't all that many angular specific things to learn. Perhaps it would take 30 minutes to learn them all? I understand there is a purist argument against it but the reality is not that there are hundreds of things in your html, really you hardly use anything besides if statements and loops.
In the same way that jQuery or Moment is a library? That's a good one.
have you developed an app in 2x? They're very similar.

"React is less opinionated" is like if angular shipped without core directives. You are going to use a router, probably redux router, and that's because you are going to use redux (or flux but nobody uses flux anymore). Less opinionated, but there's only a few right ways to construct a modern react way. It not shipping with additional features doesn't make it less opinionated. Angular doesn't ship with a router, wow look at composable it is.
Angular does have a router. There's no need to get so defensive, react is great but I doubt that angular is going away, especially for the companies already used to using angular as a front end framework. My job is literally going to angular 2 solely because they don't believe react is a large enough benefit to switch to, and I am sure many other companies will think the same thing. 
I love react, I love angular. I just think people say weird shit about react, I don't know I guess because someone else said it. React is a very opinionated framework. You can hang yourself with shitty separation of concerns in either.

I think reacts render method is great, I like JSX. I think they're more similar than they are different. The real difference is React is more "pure" and angular created a dependency injection shim for JS.  Again, I love react, but just because you have to wire more shit up (in the code, not just the addtl libs) doesn't mean it doesn't have a clearly defined "right" approach. 
So...........what accounted for the difference in the A/B test with two identical sites?

And how do you measure in only one direction?? You're measuring the increase in conversions, but not a decrease in conversions? I don't get it. It's the same number, one's just positive and the other negative. How can you measure one without the other, and why would you *ever* not want to measure both? Article does a poor job of explaining one-tail vs two-tail IMO.
Despite the clickbait headline, interesting.
Pointless article. When you split test two identical copies it is always different at first and the point at which they come back close together is the point at which you have reached a good level of statistical relevance.
This is really interesting to me but I have to say that I'm reassured that there's no "novelty" effect in play with the a/b tests I have been running because they are targeted entirely on our onboarding flow which only have new visitors. I could be wrong but it seems like a reasonable assumption.
Positive and negative numbers are not the same. You test in one direction by using a one-tailed test. The article lays out examples for one and two-tailed test cases.

The delusional results are mostly likely from the testers being uneducated or uninformed with statistical math ideas. e.g. Not enough test data, not understanding basic statistics, assuming their changes would bring positive effect, etc. 

I'm surprised the service that the author used didn't give a statistical significance on those shiny numbers. "Variation #1 is beating Variation #2 by +18.1%" means absolutely nothing if it doesn't come with a statistical significance, or "statistical power" as the author puts it. But then again, these companies want to sell their services with big promises of "quick and dirty" results. 
**In layman's terms:**   
You're asking what accounted for the difference in the A/B test with two identical sites. You need to ask the question: "Are they truly different or the same given the data?"

Just because the numbers say that they are different doesn't truly mean they are different. That is the point of doing the stats test in the first place. The goal of the stats test is to be able to say:    

"We can say that Split A is *statistically significantly* 15% better than Split B *with 95% confidence.*"

Two-tailed vs One-tailed testing is matter of math. The math behind a two-tailed test is more stringent, and requires greater sample size and testing duration. The author is accusing Optimizely of merely using a one-tailed test in scenarios where a two-tailed test would be more appropriate. This ties into the author's point about Optimizely using a green indicator when a test is supposed to be statistically significant, when in actuality the results may not be yet, leading to him presenting results to his bosses that ended up not being true.

Edit: To answer your original question though, what could explain the difference between the two identical splits is a matter of chance. Flip a coin 100 times, and flip a coin 10,000,000 times. Your results will vary, but the test with 10,000,000 samples will probably give you a closer number to the true probability of outcomes.
I sent it to a client considering a major A/B test. I haven't done a lot of execution of these tests and almost none of the planning so the one-tailed vs two-tailed explanation was extremely valuable. 
It's not pointless.

An A/B tool should not be telling you there is an 18% difference between two identical variations and then claiming it's 100% accurate, *at any point during the test, whether it's a short run or a long run*.

If it says it's 100% during a long run / large sample size, it means it's broken. Critical bug level 9000 broken. 

If it's 100% during a short run / low sample size, it means it's over-confident. 

In either case, it's unreliable.
> The delusional results are mostly likely from the testers being uneducated or uninformed with statistical math ideas. e.g. Not enough test data, not understanding basic statistics, assuming their changes would bring positive effect, etc.

Well... a site like that should probably give you all the info you need. I shouldn't have to read a textbook on stats before I can use it; that's just a bad service.

> I'm surprised the service that the author used didn't give a statistical significance on those shiny numbers. 

I thought that's what the "100%" on the right was? 
>  Flip a coin 100 times, and flip a coin 10,000,000 times. Your results will vary, but the test with 10,000,000 samples will probably give you a closer number to the true probability of outcomes.

Right, but I'm assuming Optimizely would have sent the same number of visitors to each. The number of "heads" might still come out different with the same number of flips, but you're analogy isn't quite apt.

> You're asking what accounted for the difference in the A/B test with two identical sites. You need to ask the question: "Are they truly different or the same given the data?"

Right.... and Optimizely reported that they *are* different with 100% certainty. What am I missing? 


> I shouldn't have to read a textbook on stats before I can use it; that's just a bad service.

I understand that as a user you shouldn't need to. But you also need to realize this isn't some fundamental additions and multiplications. I would think it's up to the service provider to make things clear for merchants or developers.

> I thought that's what the "100%" on the right was?

Yeah, I'm not sure what the author really meant. I don't think you can have a 100% statistical significance. Also, even the result was 99.95% *likely* to be correct, it doesn't mean it will be validated in the real world. 

In any case, it's been a while since I studied statistics, and I was never a statistician, but the reality is that this is a complex subject. 
The analogy wasn't meant to explain the stats of a website performance, just the effect of sample size on accuracy. Let's take a look at this example: let's say there are 1000 visitors to a website. 500 are given Split A, and 500 are given Split B. Split A sees 50 conversions, or 10%, whereas Split B sees 75 conversions, or 15%. There is still the likelihood that this is purely out of *chance*, and Split A and Split B are actually identical in performance. Or heck, Split B could actually perform worse than Split A. To evaluate those probabilities, you need a larger sample size, and a more stringent mathematical test (i.e. two-tailed).

Optimizely reported that one split performed better than the other, and expects the user to trust that judgment and end the experiment earlier than statistically required. That is their fallacy. They said the data was "statistically significant" but not at what confidence interval, or what kind of stats test was done. In the author's case, Optimizely's bad handling of statistics led to him, and possibly many other users to report inaccurate results to their peers. Hence, when his company evaluated actual contribution to revenue, the lift wasn't as high as Optimizely was claiming, and the spotlight was put on him.
>Right.... and Optimizely reported that they are different with 100% certainty. What am I missing?    

In statistics, a 100% confidence interval would require a sample size of infinity to resolve. There is *always* the chance of the opposite hypothetical event occurring. 
> require a sample size of infinity to resolve

Well, not infinity, just the entire target population :D
Something like [Google analytics](https://www.google.com/analytics/)?
www.similarweb.com gives you *some* of that. In my limited research, it's not entirely accurate, but I haven't seen results that are completely off (at least not yet).
Yes, but for other people's sites. Does Google Analytics provide metrics for sites that aren't your own?
No. 
Being able to build my ideas. 
Being able to look at a website and understand how it was made, what causes the problems, even being able to debug issues and find ways around them. I always feel so smug when I can disable a badly made paywall by hiding the element.
The money, women, drugs and adulation.
If you had asked me three years ago, I would have told you: getting paid to do what I love and solving interesting problems every day.  

Now that I run an agency, the answer is different.  It's the awesome people who have shown up to be on my team.

Today I had a long flight from Tokyo to Paris.  On the flight I was watching a video of Mark Zuckerberg getting interviewed by Paul Graham.  He said something like, "If we were in an alternate universe where I didn't start the company, it would be an honor to work for any of my execs."   I feel exactly the same way about the people on my team.
I'm an industrial mechanic, not a web developer. Starting learning the basics two years ago, started- stopped, started again. Needed a project. Decided to make a big website with about 50 html pages showing how to do every job I do at work. One day I showed it to my boss, he was stunned and wanted me to do this for the entire plant. Friendly IT guys at our home plant said they would help and host my files on their dev server. They then messed up all my code, and told everyone I didn't know what I was doing. First lesson, IT guys hate it when mechanics want to play in their sandbox. So I threw together a computer, taught myself how to set up my own server, and my Linux/Nginx combo has now been 'live" for a month. Site is over 5 gigs and growing everyday. I set up MariaDB on my server and PHP and am gonna try to set up a bar coding system for all our parts. IT really hates me now, but my division tells me I'm a "rock star". I really have no idea what I'm doing, I feel like a fraud. I google things constantly. What web dev did for me was allow me to carve out a niche and job that never existed before in my company. Now they want me to learn Python for some scada project that is coming down the pike. Fun 
I see a lot of family members, friends, and old school buddies struggling to find even a low paying job. Meanwhile I work a high paying job, after turning down another high paying offer, all before I've even graduated. Sometimes I just have to stand back and think how nice it is to be financially secure before I'm even done with college. That's something so many others can't say.
The mix of art and science.
A normal person will be walking around their house and think dang, I wish I could have a site where I could post pictures of plants but they would think, too bad I can't do that though, then proceed to forget about the idea while I could think of that idea and think, OK, let me rent an instance on AWS, download rails, and get started.
It gives me an excuse to drink...

brb going to do some web development
I have ideas and make them happen. That feels awesome.
My customer's computer has an excellent set of front end diagnostic and debugging tools on it.
Solving problems.
The job security is wonderful. I was laid off and started learning to code a year ago. I got a job 6 months later, and since then I've gotten a good job and I've been able to learn, solve problems, and create things every day. 

I love knowing that once I move on from this job, I'll be all but guaranteed a job doing something I love and the pay will be very competitive.
The never ending learning. It's like a rabbit hole and I love that feeling. 

But then again I also hate all the learning sometimes. 
Building something that people not only use, but enjoy using. People make money by using the tools I build them, and I love that.

At our last annual conference, I announced a new tool and got a round of applause. Yes, it was three months of work, but it will save them personally 2 hours of work a day, decrease our support time by half every day, reduce the cost of training and reduce the barrier of entry. Huge impacts on our entire business, and I've never felt prouder.

On the down side, it's in itself a huge support and development cost for the next few months, but the effort I will be worth it.

I love seeing people use what I build.
I would say the community. Web developing (really all programming fields but web development seems to lead the charge) communities have the most resourceful people in them willing to share tools and knowledge to anyone else willing to learn, for free.
Having a hobby that's profitable.
Knowing that if I spend months on something behind closed doors I can get instant gratification when I launch it to the world, anyone can go play with someone I've been working hard on. I'd hate to work in a job where you build things people will never see or appreciate, other than a small number of people in your company/industry.
Being able to work anywhere really with an Internet connection and a laptop.
Working from home.
Well, money is very nice - but simply put I've got a pretty strong desire to learn as much shit as possible and web dev is one of those fields that require you to continually stay on top of everything...so that constant stimulation is nice. Building my ideas, seeing something tangible i created, and end-users enjoying it is pretty motivating 
It's all puzzles all day long.
The money is good, there's plenty of jobs. Don't have a degree but have a cool project on Github? There's probably a couple of companies willing to give you a chance.

Meanwhile, my sister got a law degree with very good grades from a good university, but struggled to find a job because she wasn't affiliated with the right political party and didn't have the right connexions.
I love to watch as a new idea or project springs to life before my eyes after spending an adequate amount of time refining the basis for my creation. I am currently employed at a startup in Wilmington, NC, which will be shutting down in July, but I have learned so much and have officially switched my pursuit of iOS development to web development.
At its best, it's a fun game.

There's a goal (make some stuff happen) and there's a limited number of tools to do it with (the command set and syntax in PHP, or whatever) and you have to make it happen just by slotting those tools together.

For me, I love pure programming. I can happily do without arty stuff like design and branding, but I love the game of making something work.
It'd be a tie between solving problems and learning new things daily. Doing something mentally stimulating on a daily basis has always been something I've strived for, and ever since I started learning front-end just under 2 years ago, that itch has been thoroughly scratched.

I also really enjoy the design/UX aspect of building a site, along with being able to just think of an idea and execute it. 
Every problem can be solved.
Compile times. And how there aren't any (in the languages I use, anyway). The other project I occasionally have to work on takes at least an hour to build...
How fast the industry changes, and that no two projects are the same.  I do a handful of projects a year, and each time, I try to implement a new technology or library, or use a new technique I've picked up in the interim.  It can be overwhelming at first, when you're still trying to figure out the syntax of the language, best practices, not to mention code tests, etc.  Once you settle into it  though and find the "leg room" to try new things, refactor old ideas, find more optimized algorithms, etc. it can be quite fulfilling.
Be able to build something.  I have a very logical mindset and it is the first career that I've had where I don't get bored of doing it.
I really enjoy building the tools that make it easier to build web apps.

I've got a lot of web apps I want to make, but I always get frustrated with the tooling. I always feel like framework designers are idiots and I have to jump through so many hoops to do the things I actually want to do.
Well the pay is nice, and so is sitting at an office all day pissing around on a computer.
I first and foremost love the internet, so being a part of it is amazing to me. I love the community and how many resources we create for one another. I love troubleshooting and building things; the actual creation process and the sense of achievement once it's "done". I love that web dev is a perfect intersection of my passions/skills in art, design, computers, psychology, linguistics...

Of course, having a stable, well-paying job out of college was great too.
How cool girls think I am.
Ha! that is great.
Being in high demand!
This is literally the only reason why I pursued programming as a career. I don't inherently 'love' coding or programming languages or computer science. I mean, sure, the challenges can be rewarding, but I don't like coding for the sake of coding, if that makes sense. I just find find so much joy out of having an idea and then seeing it come to life. There are very few feelings in my life as rewarding to me as creating something.

Coding is a tool to build ideas, and I want to master it. The prospects of being able to build something one day that is great (if that day ever comes) pushes me to keep improving
I would go further and say "being able to design my ideas with code"
The prize is when you finish and realize you've created something and it's good. That gives me the drive to do it again. 
This.
I'm sad I've never thought of this. Brilliant!
This and looking at source code is fun as fuck. It's like being able to decipher hieroglyphics.  

Plus you learn more by looking at, and trying to understand better code.
...or lack thereof
Hold on to that feeling; it's rare in most business settings!
This feeling of "feeling like a fraud" comes up very often - it's called "impostor syndrome." In fact, it comes up *so often* that some redditors even feel we're starting to abuse the term (to mean even the slightest iota of self-doubt). But I still mention it when appropriate, to people who may need to be reminded that the vast majority of us are not super coding geniuses that pump out thousands of lines of perfect optimized code a day. Progress is progress, and your problem-solving attitude (in my opinion) is what makes you a true developer. Cheers and good luck.
awesome
Awesome, ignore the IT haters. Well don't ignore them entirely, they *may* have some good criticisms. Keep learning and solving problems!
You should see if you can get them to pay your tuition to one of these 3 month web development immersive programs: https://generalassemb.ly/education/web-development-immersive They seem primed to go for it as your boss already sees the value you are adding to the company. 
I'm a 29 year old Paramedic just trying to get started learning web dev.

They say that if you love what you do it doesn't matter how much you make. That's a lie.

Congrats on being financially stable at such a young age. That's an accomplishment most people can't claim.
Just the other day I was thinking "People need to see my houseplants". So I logged on, created a T2.mirco, set up a repository on GitHub to push my staging from and then I thought "fuck this, I want nachos". 


I forget where I'm going with this.... 
Except, when you've done web dev long enough, you start to think every idea is stupid, and only good if there's some feature that would be enormously hard to implement, which kills your motivation, so you end up doing nothing with your skills anyway :/

Me: "People should be able to post pictures of their plants!"

Me: "But that's a silly idea, who would actually find that useful?"

Me: "I know, maybe if I offered a service that reminded people to water their plants on a schedule!"

Me: "But why use a website for that when you can just use your phone's calendar/reminder system? I need a better idea."

Me: "Oh wait, what about taking pictures of plants and then building an algorithm that can identify them and then make recommendations on how often to water them!"

Me: "Shit, that means I'll have to learn how to do machine learning, unless maybe I can hook into Google's API."

Me: "Wait, I doubt even Google's API gets any more granular than "plant", so I'm going to have to build my own machine learning / image recognition system anyway. At least that will solve the dick pic / porn problem...

Me: "But even if I do, I'd have to build a massive database of plants and optimal watering schedules, and I'm not a botanist."

Me: "Maybe I can make it a social thing, and let plant experts populate the database for me:"

Me: "That means I'll need different user accounts though, and a moderation/administration system to identify experts so not just any idiot can tell me to drown my $10,000 orchid collection"

Me: "How am I going to monetize this?"

Me: "How will I make it scale?"

Me: "Meh too much work. <opens up reddit>"

^^
Thought process of a web developer. I am my own worst enemy sometimes.
yes it really blows me away not only how intensely focused web development is in general at increasing their quality of life in regards to tools but also sharing those tools with everyone else.
All devs are bros. when you have a problem, everyone wants to help you solve it.
This.  I literally do half of my work from bed.  Often with my dog sleeping next to me.
I just met someone who got their law degree and got a job as a software developer... Such a weird world...

Thats one thing that annoys me - I know a couple of girls that are obsessed with dating a doctor or a lawyer and man do we have it better than most lawyers do. Whatever, their loss.
Very well put. I've been building software/websites/webapps for almost 10 years. I enjoy the coding as a challenge, but seeing something I imagined come to life is something magical. 

I recently started using Meteor and it put it into a new level of magic. If you're proficient in JS, you can almost get stuff working as fast as you can think of it.

Just today, I finished the first version of an app. FINISHED. I don't think I've every "finished" something ever before. Awesome. 
Its male human nature to want to build, conquer, and master a craft. I too piked webdev because of this. I can confidentially say it was the best decision I've made and I wish I made it sooner.
Same, though I've grown to love programming / webdev as a craft in the process.  Someone could hire me to build a social network for gophers (not too far off from some of the startups I see these days) and I'd be perfectly happy.
Really? I thought this was our most well known superpower.
As a relative novice, I find this encouraging. It makes me optimistic that I can really jump in and start getting paid for doing web dev sooner rather than later. I've already been the "impostor" in another industry... I can't wait to immerse in something I actually am interested in (that pays well too!).
LOL they are already getting leery about losing me eventually, however they really don't have much to worry about. No matter what my skills are there isn't a company on earth who would hire a 48 year old guy as a web developer. I have to admit being the only "web guy" at my company is kinda neat.
Hahah I'm a swim coach making the change now as well. Money talks.
You were probably going somewhere fast but then realized, "Shit. I'm out of chips. Let me run to the store and get some chips to make some nachos." And then you just left it at that.
Logically your next step would be to build a nacho delivery site like pizza hut except nacho-ey.
This, so many times.
Does anyone have some tips to avoid this situations?Most of the time I end up doing this.
can confirm.. have degree in molecular biology... am working web dev and (hopefully in the future even more) occasionally video editing/motion graphics.
To be honest, I wouldn't want to be around such gold-digging, status-chasing people. That's why I drive a Kia.
I'm new to JS and I actually really loved Meteor too. How do you normally deploy your Meteor applications? I'm very new to Node outside of just using gulp and it was sort of a stumbling block for me.
Absolutely! Feel free to PM me with any questions, I'd love to help if I can.
Yes, money talks, but IMO, most people only doing it for the money will hit a ceiling and always be beat out by people who care, because people who love what they do will always be  pushing themselves to improve and won't be pacified by money. Web dev requires a lot of dedication to stay up to date, and I'm of the opinion that the people who care more will work harder to push themselves to stay on top of things and adhere to best practices than the people jumping on the wagon for monetary reasons.

This of course does not mean that if money is one's primary motivation that they won't be successful- I know for a fact that there will be many people ONLY motivated by money who will be far more successful than anyone else. I'm just making a generalization.

P.S. I'm not implying you or the paramedic are only doing it for the money- I don't know your circumstances or motivations.
Nacho Shed 

Similar to Uber, a stylish slick app that allows drunks/lazy buggers order nachos from locals willing to cook them. 
Scale down to minimum use and open source tools, try it out, and put it on github?
If you are just building a simple app you want to deploy it somewhere quickly, use `meteor deploy`, and put it on meteors servers.

If you are using some more complex functionality (I have a separate admin app and front end app both using the same db for example) use the amazing [meteor up](https://github.com/arunoda/meteor-up), or look into the paid hosting service meteor provide.
At first I thought you were saying it exists and I immediately tried to find it but instead only got https://nachocove.com/ (the disappointment was real). this should be a thing, you know, like drunk food specialized delivery. maybe you can even have the delivery guy show up with bags of candy, chips, etc, to upsell! my god.
Yeah, at the time I was only able to just do a simple built-in meteor deploy. Outside of that I got pretty lost :< I'll look into meteor up though!
I like the idea of upselling on delivery. Really appeals to the drunk/stoned demographic.


When I was at Uni (UK), there was a local business which would deliver McDonalds, KFC, Subway etc. for when you're hungover.
I can say with certainty that my time in college was excellent mainly because of a tea house that delivered hot boba tea to your apartment / dorm till like midnight. 
That site is done with [d3.js](http://d3js.org), and I'm guessing a lot of custom code. D3 is powerful and pretty frickin amazing, but you don't get something like that out of the box. 
cheers, dunno why I didn't think of that!
Firstly you need a server side component that will provide the data you want. This will talk to the database, can be written in whatever language you want - php is an option - and provides the data in json over http.

Secondly, the angular page talks to this API using Ajax calls, and gets the data that way.

Done right, you can use the same API for third party integrations, for mobile apps, and whatever you want.
As others have said, you need a backend. My question is are you dead set on SQL? If not you could look at the MEAN stack, Mongo, Express, Angular and NodeJS, there is a really good yeoman generator for it https://github.com/angular-fullstack/generator-angular-fullstack it will setup an example project for you with frontend, backend and DB, and you can see how it all ties together.
As an example, [here is my AngularJS app](https://github.com/cheshire137/blicblock-js) built with a Ruby on Rails HTTP API. 
I built an app that does this for you https://github.com/Leo-G/Flask-Scaffold. It uses a python API to communicate with angularjs and store data in the database. Try is and let me know if you have any questions
If you are dead set on MySQL, you need an API of some sort. They are pretty easy to build in Laravel / Lumen
I had this issue too. 
So what i did was use php to convert it to a json string..then the json can connect to angular. Please pm i need help installing angular on apache.....i can show u how i took my data and converted it to json.....
Short answer: A backend.
I would suggest http://loopback.io/ it makes setting up APIs simple
So what I'm really trying to do, then... Is write some PHP to talk to MySQL? Which the Angular can talk to via AJAX calls? Am I understanding this correctly?
Thanks for showing me that generator! I'll definitely check it out.

It's a matter of my work wanting me to learn SQL, mostly.
I'll be looking at this for sure. Thanks!
He'll need an API anyway. He really doesn't want any random browser connecting to the database directly. 
"Installing angular on Apache" is a meaningless thing to say. 
To expand on why it's meaningless - AngularJS is client-side. Apache has nothing to do with it. To "install" angular all you do is reference it in HTML with a <script> tag. Ta-da. But any AngularJS tutorial would show you this too.
Exactly right, yes. But it doesn't need to be php - any server side language will do, as long as it produces valid output that your JavaScript can understand - normally json...
You need some form of HTTP Api in the middle. That's the only way you'll be able to communicate with your database. 
Actually  [CouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org/) is designed to allow just that.
Could use nosql
Im a newbie......  but what about the dependencys to get it to work....like installing via bower and other npm prompts for nodejs ? I know u add a script and reference angular...but thats embedded on a single page. How do u do mvc webapp with injextions for mutliple pages? 
Could you elaborate? Does PHP work as an HTTP api?
Yeah, you can do it with PHP. Look into rest APIs, which work really well with Angular
To be clear, you could have your Angular app directly communicate with your SQL database, although this would be insane as you're allowing a direct client connection to the database. Angular code runs directly on the client's browser. It means that any user with a small amount of knowledge of SQL could open up the JS file you've included, take the SQL database's location, username & password for themselves and CRUD whatever they want. Also client-side SQL solutions are probably terrible because there is no need for them except maybe in very very very niche cases.

The reason you'd use server side code (PHP, NodeJS, etc) is because you want to strictly and efficiently control who can access info from your SQL database, what they can excess, even when they can access etc. A PHP file is evaluated on the server and only information explicitly directed to do so is sent to the client. So let's say a PHP file (fruit.php) exists that has a set of instructions like this:

1. Stores the username, password and location of the SQL database in an object.
2. Connects to database using above details ([instructions - SQLi is the driver in PHP that lets you interact with SQL dbs](http://www.w3schools.com/php/php_mysql_connect.asp))
3. Retrieves a table of fruit, as you decide in your query and stores it in another object.
4. Converts this PHP object to a JSON string (string representation of a JSON object - php doesn't handle JSON objects natively - uses its own kind of object) e.g. echo json_encode($result);
5. Displays this JSON string using the php "echo" function. 

So when a public user accesses fruit.php, all they get back is a text representation of a JSON object. They have no access to the SQL details and cannot see the source. But of course, a JSON object is not very useful to most people. So from here, you make an AJAX call with angular like this:

$http.get("http://example.com/fruit.php")
    .then(function(response) {$scope.fruits = response.data.fruits;});

APIs obviously get a lot more complex than this. We can pass variables into fruit.php to access specific information. Maybe accessing fruit.php?color=yellow will only return yellow fruits. Maybe you need authentication to access it so you need to pass a session token or one time token each time.

I would recommend following W3schools PHP tutorial and its SQL tutorial before attempting to build anything substantial. I would then recommend developing a brief understanding the concept of REST APIs. For beginners, all you need to know is that REST APIs describe a certain architecture and certain rules for implementing an API that is very solid. I would then recommend learning something like Silex (a PHP framework for implementing a REST API in node). This makes developing an API massively easier and forces you to make better choices than trying to make one from scratch.

All an API essentially is, is an interface between one thing and another thing. E.g. an interface between an angular app, and an SQL database.

Edit: Downvote why?
Yeah, you just use a query string, e.g. www.website.com/request.php?command_id=5&param_1=x&param_2=y


and in your php code you just have

$command = $_GET['command_id']

$param_1 = $_GET['param_1']

$param_2 = $_GET['param_2']


then do your processing with the URL data, and output whatever you need. 
You're possibly getting downvoted because you're wrong. You can't connect an Angular frontend to a SQL server without a backend. It's just not possible.

You could also be being downvoted because you're recommending that someone goes to w3schools, which is a horrible website. There's much better places to learn php, and much, much better places to learn sql.
[It is technically possible with a particular setup - IE8 or SQL 2005 Web Services, but it is not something that should be done.](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/857670/how-to-connect-to-sql-server-database-from-javascript-in-the-browser). I do mention that the solutions are terrible because there is no demand for such a solution.

Yeah W3schools isn't great but as an initial primer which OP needs I find it is very straightforward. Anyway, thanks for replying at least.
Holy shit, that's awful, why is that even possible?

Love this bit of the answer though!

> And there are rumors of an ancient legend about the existence of server javascript, but this is another story. ;)

That was written about 10 days before node.js was released.
pword is saving a password hash right?
What software is that?
Under user privilege table, is ban users there twice? And why isn't there an association with the banned table? Or does that table refer to banned rooms? 
Can there be multiple owners of the same room? If not, then the `owner` table can be removed. Same goes for the `profile` table, if there's a one-to-one relation with `user`, I don't see any particular reason to separate the two.

I don't quite understand what the column `owner` in the `room` table is used for. Same with `banned` in the same table.
Some thoughts:

- In my experience, it's almost always useful to have a `created_at` timestamp column on a table. Just set it to `now()` by default and forget about it. For example, it would be useful to know when a user was added to the banned or owner tables.
- It'd also be useful to know *who* added a user to the banned/owner tables.
- Instead of inserting/deleting from the banned/owners tables, it's often nicer to only insert, like an append only log. That way you always have a paper trail of what happens. For example, if there's some drama and billy promotes me as an owner and then sally gets pissed off and demotes billy and then me, then you have that recorded in your data model, especially if you have a `inserted_by_user_id` column in each one. 
- Looks like `*_dtg` is your convention for timestamps. Personally I like `*_at`. Petty, I know.
- It's also nicer to use `*_id` for foreign keys. Like `banned_id` and `owner_id` in the `room` table.
- Depending on your application, it can sometimes be more convenient to store a `role` field for each user/room combo instead of each possible permission as its own boolean field. Classic example is `admin`, `mod`, `member`, `banned` and then dispatching privilege checks against that. This solution is simpler if you don't actually need per-user granular control. In a chat app, the granular control makes sense (the way you have it), though.

That's not a checklist, just thinking out loud. Your schema looks good to me.
Salted hash, just like mom used to make.
[This.](http://ondras.zarovi.cz/sql/demo/)
nope, typo, made the same col twice.

the ban_users in the privilege table is a bool, if the user is allowed to ban others in that room_id.
Yes, multiple owners of the same room, under the `user_privilege` table different users can do different things, I'm removing the     `banned` and `owner` cols. Instead I will have a `root_owner`, who cannot be removed and has overall control. 

As for the separate `profile` table, thats part of the experiment. 

As for the separate     
If you're interested in secure password storage, salts are no longer the way to go. Look into functions like scrypt or argon(?). The second was buzzing around recently. 
Cool, thanks!
Makes sense. Good work.

Beyond Compare. It's not free but from trying many tools I like its feature set the best.
Kaleidoscope 
p4merge. Got used to it when perforce was our version control. 
Pure command line for me.
Visual studio code has awesome diff compare
There's a nice package for Atom called [merge-conflicts](https://atom.io/packages/merge-conflicts) that I usually use.
meld works for me
kdiff3, trying to figure out vimdiff.
Diffuse and WinMerge.
I use opendiff.  

No specific reason besides it is what I have been using since I started working with xcode.
I usually wind up on diffchecker. So far I haven't needed that much functionality in a diff tool, so I just google it real quick.
There is a diff plugin for sublime text that works well (can be found through package control)
Kdiff3 is great. http://naleid.com/blog/2012/01/12/how-to-use-kdiff3-as-a-3-way-merge-tool-with-mercurial-git-and-tower-app
I prefer the command line but source tree is nice
Guy I work with wrote this, and it's nice. https://github.com/scottgonzalez/pretty-diff
For git merge conflicts, I usually give up and just edit the file manually.
Vim + Fugitive.

I used to use kdiff and then Kaleidoscope. Vim isn't as pretty, but it's nice to do everything in the editor now.
Yeahhh! The Jetbrains IDEs come with the most fabulous diff tool ever devised. The differences are really clear, and when you're comparing two files you can make direct edits to both. I've told them they should sell it as a separate product but they want to focus on IDEs. Download a free trial and give it a whirl!
Beyond Compare is amazing.
Beyond Compare is a great tool, but I don't really use it for diffs.

I work at a place which still does manual deployments for a specific product (lame), and Beyond Compare comes in really handy for them. But the diff tool in Webstorm is just too convenient.
Same here - Perforce was the first version control I ever used, and I just got used to the way p4diff lays out the versions.
Same here. I use `git diff`with colors configured for git. I didn't even realize that there were other tools for handling diffs. I'm not opposed to trying something new; I just haven't. I could see something more guided than git's output being useful for files that undergo heavy parallel churn.
This. I swear by it and on it's own it has converted many a co-worker to using JetBrains IDEs themselves.
For starters, a lot happens on the page except from one (the most) important thing, an input field for my link. Iâ€™m somewhat confused by the giant unlabelled arrows. The prominent about page makes me thinks itâ€™s someoneâ€™s pet peeve (which off course I already knew it is), which makes me wonder: are my shortened links alive in a year or so? 

There is also the question of whether a link shorter is still relevant *aside* from tracking, every sharing platform has proprietary url shorteners/and or crawled meta data alongside links. 

I understand the limited relevance in relation to your project goals in many aspects, but these are my first impressions. 

Edit: I just opened my inspector: 46 console warnings (mostly bootstrap related) and 1.1MB in file size with 30 requests, which seems a tad excessive for a simple page like this.
So many requests and large files for this?


â€œhttps and basically allows to shorten links anonymously linksâ€ eh?
Tyvm for the feedback. 

I changed the page flow a lot of times, from the start where I only had the basic URL input + the logo to now where I introduced several pages on it. That's one of the mai reasons why I wanted some feedback on it, because I really don't know if that could be fine. I agree on the giant arrows, have to change them :P.

The about section was an idea of my friend. I was about to put a smaller page at the end with just a mention (if you are registered, the page below the links you have submitted as registered user). Some friend thought it was nice to have a separate page since other pages were implemented already, so I decided to give it a try

The shortener I understand every sharing platform has, it's not about going commercial or anything, just more like an experiment than anything else (to make my first API with authentication and email verification in nodejs, to check how fast things go etc etc)
ye.. still didn't work trying to reduce the amount of requests, still working on the page itself
OUPS, sorry, edited it for some typos and seems I copied that, edited tho.
Tyvm 
Take Google for example, itâ€™s a logo and an input for a search query. Below there are small links with company policies etc., in the top right (i think) you can login/get notified. Itâ€™s the simplicity that makes it work, right away anyone knows what is expected.

Just to be clear, I did not mean commercial either (although it can be), but just the sake of ease when you can post a longform - unambiguous - link to any sharing platform anyway, itâ€™s likely what most people tend to do just that.
I agree, simplicity is what makes everything better (I mean, easier to understand/use, lighter in terms of network usage/device cpu etc). As I said, still have another previous and unfinished version of it (without registered users) [that was planned like that] (http://twos.io:3013/) if you want to check it out.

Problem came when I tried to make appear the list of links to a registered user, needed another page and didn't want to redirect (I wanted a single page app) so it's when I started to make different screens and animations in between.
Chrome already does this natively
Pretty sure most of these situations are handled by apps like Pushbullet.
If they're logged in from both devices, you could provide a "sync session" switch.
Safari on OS X/iOS does this already. 
Does it assume devices only have a single user or does it only show you notifications from your devices when you logged in as yourself?
You have to log in with a Google account (Facebook is also supported I think).
Thanks, I'll have to check it out.
We have separate builds on our Jenkins server for production and staging. Staging builds off of master. When we have a commit on the master branch that we're ready to push to production, we tag it, point the production build to that tag, and build production.

Individual servers are configured via Chef Solo and are scaffolded with Terraform. 
We have transitioned over time. I'll give you the story of one of our longest-running sites.

In the beginning it was CVS(!) just rolling straight out to the live server from dev machines. Our dev machines were kind of like live, but no one really checked package versions etc. The dev machines ran a different flavour of Linux to the live machine.

This was replaced by SVN, which was replaced by Mercurial. We standardised on one flavour of Linux. We began going via a test server to live, but not technically staging, as it wasn't set up in quite the same way as live. We also began scripting dev VM setup, with a load of shell scripts to fetch code, instal the right package versions etc. 

We then switched to using a staging server (set up identically to live with a few key differences) and switched to Git around the same time. Began running loads of Jenkins tests on various test VMs, both by hand before deployment and nightly. We also began building the website code as a Debian package and had a build server to create the package and roll that out. 

We then switched to using Ansible to build the Debian package. We'd have a "command and control" machine which would do all of the logging in etc. and we'd trigger this using Jenkins.  We now use Vagrant to bring up dev VMs locally, and once we've pushed our commits, we can run a suite of tests via Jenkins. Once these pass, we use Ansible to roll out the tested package to staging, re-test in as close to a live environment as we can, and then out to the live servers.

Anyone who is a novice at building websites and has to get their head around Git, Puppet/Chef/Ansible, Jenkins (or some other CI solution) and then Docker/Vagrant gets some serious respect from me. The tooling these days is great although as a result there is a lot to learn. We've introduced all of it by doing the simplest thing first, and then improving our processes. We saw the need for it and brought it in. I think this is the best way for any development team to proceed. 

For a lone developer, say a freelancer, I would urge this approach even more.
If you have a budget, ask for a little more and run Bamboo. If not, TravisCI.
I've used git to deploy production code. I also set up a staging.mydomain.com subdomain where I also used git. With git, you can tag your commits I with version numbers which helps when deploying. Here's some discussion on the topic: http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/45452/is-using-git-for-deploying-a-bad-practice

So my workflow would be 1. Develop locally. Commit. Push to remote repository. 2. Pull to staging environment. Verify everything's working then 3. Pull to production environment. 
I develop on Ubuntu. Git is my most crucial most used tool. My LAMP setup closely mimics my servers.

All my sites have a private repo on Gitlab. I commit there and push daily. I develop locally and also push to live. I either work from my desktop at home, and sometimes I like to leave the "office" and head to a coffee shop for a scenery change :) A git pull and I'm working.

Soon I plan on setting up a subdomain for client approval stages. But haven't had to set that up yet.
`git checkout master && git merge --no-ff develop`
CI triggers staging rebuild.

`git tag v0.0.1`
CI triggers production rebuild.
Personally I have:

Local VM - This is where I do all of my actual testing, getting code to work. It is set up as a mirror clone as the servers I deploy my code on to. I use npm and composer to manage dependencies. I then git push to our development git branch.

Staging Server - Again a clone of the actual server, used to everything is merged correctly and everything works together. Used to give links to the boss to check over the features before they go live. Once its all signed off on it gets merged into the main branch.

Actual server - Automatically pulls from main branch, runs a deploy script that ensures the database has its correct migrations run and then runs any aditional migration scripts. The site is down for about a period of 20 seconds when I push to live. Thats purely because I didnt want a chance of anything going badly as people browse the sites, I could have made it seamless but it had the opputunity to create errors.

Not a perfect setup but yeah it works. Relatively pain free.
I've been meaning to do similar stuff. I've been getting a lot of mileage out of docker, just on my dev machines alone, which is tempting me to take it into production, but the vendor keeps saying that docker isn't production ready. Kinda disappointing. Might have to finally learn some chef and Jenkins can offer such a great view and bridge into your automated systems.
Going a step further you could use a CI like Codeship to automatically detect the pushes to Github, run tests on them, then push to staging/production (depending on which branch you pushed to). That way you don't have to manually git pull and the tests are running on a separate server. I use Codeship for automated deployments onto Elastic Beanstalk with great success.
Where is your remote repository? Is it on the same server as your production environment?
Where is Gitlab hosted?
We use Vagrant and Chef for dev machines. We can't use virtual machines on our computers (security), so we use the AWS provider for Vagrant (that way we can also bill our developer machines to a client's AWS account), and then roll all of the accounts together into the master company account which allows us to hit a higher usage bracket for bandwidth and pay less per tb.
I use bitbucket's free private repos.

or if you want to host your own https://about.gitlab.com/downloads/
Whilst I like your setup, you're responding to someone who says:

>with cPanel

I don't think they are going to find this remotely suitable.
Is there something wrong with cPanel? I'm not saying this condescendingly either. I have a VPS to host all of my clients and I use cPanel to manage their accounts and space.
If you're running cPanel, you're almost certain to be:

* Sharing a server amongst multiple businesses, with poor isolation
* Limited to PHP as a backend
* Using suPHP which decimates performance
* Above all, never using a shell, and thus, not properly using git, composer, gulp, or any other modern tooling
* Look at what I responded to. "We use vagrant and chef". I'd put good money on the fact you are not.
It looks like this only runs on linux.
It also runs on Mac and I don't remember having using anything Unix specific, so you should be able to compile it in Windows without any changes.
What benefits might one gain by using Lua for building web applications over ruby, python, or javascript? I've always wanted to check it out, but there are too many other languages in the way at the moment.
This looks as something interesting to use with LuaJIT. Is there a way to have an HTTP/1.1 setup with only Lua code? Something more or less equivalent to gunicorn or uwsgi?
This sounds interesting.
Lead developer of Sailor here:

1 - The programming language is better. Better at least than javascript and PHP for sure, and perhaps better than python and ruby as well, but I'd have to make a deeper analysis to show you why I think that. In terms of programming language design, Lua is a great language, very concise and consistent on its semantics. It is more readable. And has interesting mechanisms such as metatable and hybrid implementation of tables. It's high quality and well-maintained tech. It's really worth the time to read some of the papers about it.

2- Performance. Lua is faster than all of those. It's the fastest interpreted language i've heard of. The JIT implementation of Lua is faster than JS v8. 

3 - Good technology such as openresty. Openresty is a bundle of nginx modules. Nginx implementation uses LuaJIT, which is super fast, and it has this interesting thing which is dealing with asynchronous I/O internally. So you can write seemingly procedural code that will be non-blocking and the events will all be handled inside nginx. That means *no callback hell*.

4 - I particularly find it a very pleasant language to work with and it ranks my top 1 in this "category" at the moment. People often underestimate the importance of this for work. This is specially good considering it's high quality tech. I used to find PHP more pleasant to work with than Java despite Java being a more well-put language, but then I needed to give excuses and it was awkward because it seemed like I didn't understand its drawbacks... Most of the time we don't need technical reasons to just enjoy a tool and it feels nice for me in the Lua world and like something I can defend technically. This also pushed me to learn more about prog lang design, which was nice.

5 - It's not new or weird to use Lua for web dev, despite what we think, websites like taobao.com, which is something like the chinese ebay, which is world's 11th most visited website, according to alexa, uses Lua in critical chunks of their code base. Lua is top 1 on the west for game dev scripting, but it is used for web dev more extensively on china. I guess they really need the performance?

6 - I'd go as far as to say it is the future of webdev, but that's my "big dream". We need more developers building tools in Lua for that first, and Lua's community is not very big, so I'm not sure how that'll go! x)

7 - Lua's community has bunchs of nice and helpful people despite being small. If you'd like to build tools for development, it's an easy way to get the community's heart without being redundant and gain prominency on your career. Nobody needs another MVC PHP framework. But the Lua community does not have the same abundance of tools. So you can build whatever you want that Lua does not have many of and lots of people will be happy. Of course this is a drawback if you're developing a product, since often you will be forced to create a library yourself instead of npm install whatever. This is changing a lot since the recent LuaRocks (Lua's package manager) updates and the ecosystem has been growing a lot lately. So I'd say this is a good time to get started and get the community's love first and then build a product ;) Or you can do like Leaf, the guy who develops MoonScript (a language that compiles to Lua like coffeescript to JS) and do both, he has a big indie game shop which he developed using the tools he made! My point is that it might be better for career to be a prominent member of the Lua community than nobody at another community, plus we are nice folks :) 

Edit: adding more bullets

Edit2: grammar
Yeah, I much prefer js or python or even go - right now. But I used lua to write a native app using corona and I have to say - lua is awesome. Maybe now it will start to gain developer share. 
A Lua programmer will try to tell you there are significant reasons to use Lua over JS because that is an assumption to which they owe their existence. They will not be able to convey those reasons to you, though, because there are none. As far as I've been able to discern, the only difference between Lua and JS are {smaller runtime, better performance(but still performs like a scripting language ofc), better syntax, very slightly cleaner semantics, aside from that godawful 1-based array indexing}. None of that is worth splitting the broader JS ecosystem for, and it's genuinely a shame, cause there are some cool things being done for Lua and I really wish we lived in a world where they'd been done for JS instead.
I am not familiar with the tools you mentioned, but I think you are looking for something like Xavante or Pegasus :) Let me know :) Sailor is able to run on Xavante and it runs on LuaJIT perfectly fine. I haven't tried making it compatible with Pegasus as well yet so I'm not sure if Pegasus runs on LuaJIT... 

http://keplerproject.github.io/xavante/

http://evandrolg.github.io/pegasus.lua/
> metatable

These don't appear to be any different to JS's prototypes?
If you think smaller runtime, better performance, better syntax, very slightly cleaner semantics are not valid reasons to use Lua then I'm speechless. Of course the ecosystem is a big drawback (which is something I mentioned), but the question was reasons to use Lua instead of reasons not to use Lua. 

Edit Adding this: Your comment looks really funny to me because you're defending JS in the same way some people defend PHP: "Yes, let's throw useless quality away, because ecosystem". So I would really wish people were developing more things in Lua instead. Many people wouldn't care about the ecosystem if that means a better quality codebase, specially on critical systems that depend on items on that list in which you said that none is worth... It will really depend on what the developer really wants.  Plus, I don't need to "try" anything for my existence. This was out of place.
Unless there were recent updates with JS's prototypes, you can't do things like operator overloading in JS. Metatables are a more powerful construct. 

Edit: removed something I'm not sure 
I suppose I should add that the only thing I like about JS is its ecosystem(well, the size of the ecosystem, anyway).

The differences between JS and Lua are insignificant to me because the difference between either of those and a language I would actually like to work with is much much larger.

(btw it's not clear what you mean by "out of place")
A fairly useless syntactical sugar? Is that it? You go on to say "metatables are a more powerful construct", is there something else you're not mentioning or does operator overloading really suffice that statement, for you?
I would hardly call operator overloading of "useless syntactical sugar". If metatables are able to do what JS prototypes do + x>0 items, than it is more powerful, so yes, it suffices. If there are things that prototypes do and metatables don't, then I'm unaware of and would appreciate your comments on that. There are things that I'm unsure though, like I said on my previous edit. I'm not sure if on Javascript we can do something like calling a table as a function. The table structure is very different than the JS concept of object, so I wouldn't know how that compares... Calling all objects as functions? Calling just arrays as functions? They are different languages afterall so not everything has a direct correlation. You can also do inheritance and multiple inheritance with metatables, using index and newindex metamethods, which I think JS prototypes don't have, but then JS has class extension and Lua has no class, so this is a similar feature at different places. But then with index and newindex you can create more things than class extension depending on your creativity. In general, Lua tends to have fewer features that are more flexible, so it depends on how you want to program. 

Edit: phrasing
I think the reason I have difficulty calling metatables a more powerful construct is that they're the same concept. The fact that prototypes will require your users to do `a.add(b)` rather than `a + b` once you've implemented all those vector types and immutable data structures that your dynamic languages are just so good at isn't a real conceptual difference.

> The table structure is very different than the JS concept of object, so I wouldn't know how that compares... Calling all objects as functions? Calling just arrays as functions? They are different languages afterall so not everything has a direct correlation.

I don't believe there's any way of calling an object, but you can treat a function as an object or an array (or put methods in the object), which is close enough for me..
There is more than that, actually. Lua has __index and __newindex metamethods, which allows for callbacks on property changes (or new properties) and a whole slew of functionality. Think of it as a js object.watch built into the prototype:

sprite.x = 100 --We could use a metamethod to "dirty" the rectangle for this sprite or do some other computations on the render tree

Where in the Boston Area?  I work in downtown Boston not far from South Station, I don't know if we hire HS interns (we hire college interns) but I can ask.  Shoot me a PM.  We're a start up NodeJS shop, so decently cutting edge (not the latest and greatest but close) and it's a pretty cool place.
Does your school not have advisers that can help with this? I know advisers can be pretty useless sometimes, but they can usually recommend *something* about internships. On top of that, find firms in your city and call them or show up at the office one day and ask. Go to meetups and other events and ask around.
There is [MediaWiki](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki) which is used by Wikipedia.
MediaWiki was definitely on my radar, so we'll see what happens. Thanks!
You know what they say about opinions. But you can find out for yourself. Pick a page that you feel uses too many divs, and recreate it using semantic tags. Obviously, the result has to look and function the same (including responsiveness, browser compatibility, etc.). Then take a step back and see what you learned.
I think that it's in some cases: *Old habits die hard.*

In other cases I think it is simply the fact that refactoring an existing code base to html5 semantic standards is not worth it.

I think the adoption comes with new projects instead.
I see the new HTML5 tags as more of high level sections of a page, but I still use plenty of divs.
Bootstrap.
Because CSS gives us very little control over the inside and outside of things. Nesting a div gives us a little extra freedom.

What we need is a div:inside and div:outside.
There are times when a div or span are the best option, as there is no other more specific tag for what you are using them for. They have always been meant as a general purpose use. But anytime you use one, you should ask yourself if a better tag exists. Each time, look over the list of available HTML tags and see if any of them are better. Keep doing this until you have that list stored mentally and you no longer need to consult it. You'll just go straight to using `<section>` or `<abbr>` or whatever the better choice is.

Often times we create automated systems that build content for us. We can't know the end results ahead of time, so we use the most general purpose tags that will still be accurate. Thus we end up with lots and lots of nested divs. There is usually no way around this, and is the safest option.
Well if you want things to be..

1. flexible in a reasonable manner and still look good visually (so that the content can be dynamically generated), and

2. responsive...

chances are you're going to need to nest divs. In fact, quite a lot of divs sometimes depending on the layout. Now, if the question is why people aren't using the new semantic tags at all in their designs, I'm not sure. I think maybe it's because they aren't explained or documented in as thorough a manner as they need to be imo. When I first learned about them, they were still confusing and I still wasn't sure what the pros/cons of them were. After a lot of absorbing different information I have a better idea now, but when you haven't used them before they just aren't advertised well so to speak.

Also consider that stylistically divs are sort of a go-to for changing formatting in the layout even if that section isn't necessarily its own entity and has similar formatting but not similar function to some other layout elements.
Like I said, divâ€™s are used sparingly in my projects. I did however recreate a google results page once, without the need for any div-tags whatsoever. Inspect the actual Google pages and get overwhelmed by the number of nested elements.
I can see how developers continue doing what theyâ€™be been taught or seen in examples for years. Even new tutorials I checked out use divâ€™s pretty much anywhere. Maybe it's time someone shows how else it could be done, but I'd need some advice on how to handle just that. I may come back on this matter.
Can you elaborate on why, or at what point you see the need to add a div element? Thanks.
Specifically Bootstrap that isn't fully integrated or without a preprocessor I would say. One could easily, in SCSS for example, have like ..

    section {
    @extend .col-sm-6;
    etc...
    }

(or, a mixin. I just have an extending habit myself, heh..)

This is is how I imagine most other front-end people do these things as well if they're using a framework + preprocessor. 
Yeah that's a pity, I am (always sorta) working on a similar system myself l, but I'm never sure is if there's a viable audience for such an investment. When done correctly - which I believe I can - it will be opinionated and cover more than just html, simply due the tight relation with css. .
I think this is somewhat the reason despite the down votes. Lots of people in tutorials still recommend to continue using divs instead of semantic markup.

Part of this is just ignorance towards semantics.
OP is referring to people using divs and spans over more semantically accurate things.

    <div id="footer">
        <span>P:</span> 1-800-123-4567
    </div>

The above would be better written as:

    <footer>
        <abbr title="Phone">P:</abbr> 1-800-123-4567
    </footer>

We don't need additional `:inside` and `:outside` psuedo classes. This would just be adding additional nesting of a virtual box-model around the existing one. I can understand the logic behind all styles required to produce a visual component should be applied to one element, and we shouldn't be adding more markup solely for the sake of styling. But this will lead to some very very ugly CSS, that could be avoided by simply wrapping a tag in another tag.

We already have a lot of freedom with `:before` and `:after`. Using those psuedo elements in combination with your markup is a better compromise that doesn't over complicate things in the same manner `:inside:inside:inside:inside:inside` would. And if you can't chain them up like that, then there's really no reason to use them at all.
I'm not sure I entirely follow, a website is a collection of predefined structures that support content that is pretty predictable in â€˜typeâ€™, which is how semantic tags were proposed in the first place. Maybe I'm missing something obvious, I'd be happy to hear about it.

I get that with wysiwyg or markup parsing it is safe to just render an <i> *or* <em> for every user-defined-italic-text, but that is mostly right at the end of the three. 
So you replaced the div tags with other tags. 

Who cares?
Can you share your code? I appreciate you starting this discussion, especially if it's to provoke a different approach to webdev, but using your own projects to support your argument does very little unless you share that code with us
Just any general purpose divider that's added for the sake of styling. Sometimes I use `section` tags as a full width block of my page then I have an inner `div` that is centered with the width to frame my page. 

So I build a page in rows like this
     

      <section>
            <div class="section__inner">

            </div>
      </section>

Also Im pretty big on using BEM CSS so I always have a class on every element, so I get no real immediate benefit from not using divs. But I try to be semantic as best I can. 

Basically if I spend more than half a second thinking "what tag should I use for this" I just make it a div
I'm not sure the OP isn't referring to both. They certainly go hand-in-hand.

> Why? In my experience nesting divâ€™s (or many whatever-elements for that manner) results in an overall speed degradation; slower development, slower maintenance, slower debugging and off course traversing the three. 

In this sense, using `article > div > section > div`  has performance issues comparable to `div > div > div > div`. The easier solution is to simply have `article > section`, which isn't always possible (as the OP states) due to styling reasons.

The HTML5 elements clean up the DOM and probably provide a marginal performance gain (for poorly written javascript) but does not solve the problem inherent to CSS. 

And if we're talking semantics, `:before` and `:after` are semantically different to `:inside` and `:outside` though they could be (and are) used as such.

The problem can crop up in Bootstrap (and similar scenarios) where you have elements that are floating left with a specific width but need extra space between those elements prior to the inside content beginning. Here is a [basic example](https://jsfiddle.net/edko6yay/1/).

edit: and perhaps there is a different/better way to get around these scenarios... if so, please do let me know!
Its not about replacing one tag for the other as much as it is about the tens to hundreds of â€˜redundantâ€™ tags wrapped around everything, from labels to inputs to images to whatever content exists, with a bonus wrapper around the wrapper so there's a wrapper for the wrapper. It just doesn't make sense to me, so therefore I was looking for some answers as to why with this thread.
Yes, absolutely. I'm just refactoring what I had (used the google page to try out my css convention-draft). I'll see what I can do for you today, otherwise I'll get back on it (because Sunday).
In that example I usually go for a div all the same. Usually it's limited to my nav and top level header though, as articles are usually occupied with sections and vice versa, already providing this semantic container. 

What helps me is creating static pattern libraries where I take more time developing html and css together, which are then applied to the website.

Thank you. 
That's tickled my brain. In my angular code I mainly stick to using directives,

So my styles are attached to the element and with SASS, all styles are then children of that element.

    <nav-bar-directive><....children....></nav-bar-directive>
CSS:

    nav-bar-directive{
        children{
            color:green;
        }
    }

The only time I'd use a class, would be for the active page in a nav number bar etc.

I'll have to look into BEM CSS, sounds interesting so Cheers!
Sure an em goes into a p which goes in a section < article < main < body. But it is rare for me to go much further beyond that. Furthermore, in my opinion this three is not only more semantic to search engines and people with â€˜alternative browsersâ€™, but also for the developer reading meaningful syntax.

I just might come up with examples, if any thing specific comes to mind let me know. 
Well, the answer is that those "redundant" tags are usually there because they actually *do* something (and are, therefore, not actually redundant).
That's roughly equivalent in its end result. You're just bypassing the need for class names by having custom elements and your signifying the relationships of elements by nesting styles, that's what BEM is all about (making the relationship of styles easy to reason about) . The only downfall to the way you're doing it; in my opinion, is you end up with very powerful selectors. That may or may not be an issue.

I still see no point in spending time, effort or money developing "native" apps. There is very little you can do in an app that you can't do on a mobile site.
Im very noob about this but, do you think mobile apps are going to die or mostly (apps like twitter, facebook, and web based)? 

sorry for my bad english 
I agree! A great responsive web implementation will be just great. There are only special cases for a mobile app. 
Can you access hardware?
Especially nowadays with React Native, Cordova, embedded browser control, etc. REST backend with JS, HTML5, CSS will get you anywhere with very minor modifications.
Not likely. Large companies can afford to develop these apps and exploit there advantages. 
Some things, like the accelerometer, yes. There are some things you cannot but, like I said, "there is very little you can't do".
Can you eli5 these emerging technologies? 
They can't afford it indefinitely. If you take into consideration overall user experience, they would all benefit from embracing better mobile sites. Ever tried to the use Facebook app on a Windows phone? It's not very good compared to the website. Developing for 900 different phones and different flavors of mobile OS is HUGELY inefficient compared to developing for 4-5 web browsers. 

I think mobile apps should die and we, as web developers, should be the ones killing them. :)

For the record, I have written mobile apps and am forced (against my constant recommendation) to maintain our current mobile at where I work. I use web technologies to build and maintain the app and Apache's Cordova to package it for publication.
I'm assuming you're asking about React Native, Cordova and embedded browser controls since REST, JS, HTML5 and CSS aren't exactly something I'd consider to be emerging tech. If I'm wrong, let me know and I'll do my best to help explain those though. :)

I've only used Cordova (https://cordova.apache.org/). Basically it takes a "www" folder full of HTML, JS, CSS, etc. and wraps it into a .apk or .xap file that you can publish the iTunes or Google Play. I believe it handles Windows phone and WebOS too but I've not used it to create apps for them.
If you're individually targetting 900 devices you're doing it wrong. 

Facebook on windows phones may be an exception to the apps being faster then websites. 

Once website can reproduce everything a mobile app can they will be obsolete. 
I want to target as many devices as possible. Using HTML is currently the most efficient way to accomplish that. 900 was just an arbitrary number used to exaggerate my point. Sorry for not making my point more clear.

The Facebook app on windows phones is just an example of the problem of trying to target many devices using apps instead of mobile websites. I was backing up my initially exaggerated point with a real world example.

I agree with you. Once a website can reproduce everything a mobile app can, apps will be obsolete. I've just chosen to focus my effort on enhancing my knowledge and understanding of making better mobile friendly sites because I feel this will benefit me in the future when mobile app developers are out of work. I'd suggest webdevs consider that potential future. 

Granted, I could be wrong...but I did see that interactive CD-ROMs were going by the wayside back in the mid 90's when I decided to focus on becoming a web developer. It seems to have paid off for me ever since.
see IBM's own guide page: http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/ibmwatson/developercloud/apis/tone-analyzer-apis.html#!/tone/post_v1_tone
IBM Watson Tone Analyzer is a web API. So you send a request to their server sending the text and you get a response with the analysis result. So you would need to write a little program that uses the APIs of Facebook / Twitter / Instagram and fetches the comments and then queries this Tone Analyzer API and then creates an overview. Not that easy for someone who is `not a coder or developer by any means`.
TIL
Ah ok - thanks. We actually have a developer in the company - would it be something the average developer could do quite quickly?
I am afraid not. Having to deal with 4 APIs and making it that user friendly that it would actually help would probably take at least a week. The twitter API for example doesn't even have the option to get all replies to a tweet. So you would need a work around (if possible).

Now that I think of it you would also need something to filter out spam.
Thanks for your reply. Excuse my lack of knowledge - so you are saying it needs to interact with the APIs from the social networks directly - so if I already had the data source (i.e. comments from our fans/followers in a ready-to-go CSV spreadsheet) it wouldn't make a difference? 
If you already had the data source you of course wouldn't need the social network APIs. If you have them as CSV it would be much simpler. What are the columns of the CSV spreadsheet?

Edit: I just tried it and to get access to an IBM Watson API you also need to have IBM Bluemix hosting (which you can apparently try out for free; but this in-order-to-use-our-nice-product-A-you-also-have-to-use-our-product-B-which-you-don't-even-want kinda sucks.)
well it kind of varies for each platform - we have a social listening tool that is able to take all of our Facebook comments into a spreadsheet - the column in which the comments are in is named "Snippet". Should be a similar situation with the Twitter replies. If you are asking about the other columns there are at least 20 of them lol - but it's not really a big deal because they can be deleted.
Hello TLI5. Just contact the companies and tell them that you have 400 hours of work to do for free, very young startups will likely have tasks that you can complete in that allocated time. We at shimmercat.com are in fact looking for a student like you to implement a security contest, but we are in another geography. Nonetheless, PM me if you want to know more. 
Would contributing to or creating an open source project be acceptable?
Yes, as long as I can clearly document and present work that I did on my own (basically prove to the board that I did 400 hours of work)
JavaScript is not Java.

You do not embed so much code in your reddit post. Instead you share it with http://pastebin.com/. Also you should provide a [minimal example](http://sscce.org/) not loads of not even properly formatted code.
First of all, as /u/larivact said, you should intent each nesting level with a single tab (2 or 4 spaces, depending on which you like more and which your editor is set to use - I prefer 2).

Without seeing your JavaScript and stylesheet(s) I can't know what's causing it not to work. What program are you using to edit it?
Sorry, still new at this.

http://pastebin.com/mXhx0Czx


I am editing with brackets. If you PM me you'r e-mail I'll send you the files. I would really appreciate the assist. 
I provided the whole page because I am not sure where I am going wrong. 
Before you do, just go into your browser and open the javascript console (right-click somewhere, click "Inspect element", and go on the Console tab). Are there any errors?
This isn't a minimal example. I can't run this because I don't have the local files that you include. I therefore can't reproduce your problem.

Your code isn't properly formatted. You should indent every nesting level with a tab. Also if you are not sure where you are `going wrong` open your Web Dev Console (`Ctrl-Shift-I`) and look for errors. Try to get your sharrre buttons working in a blank page.

By the way you can edit reddit posts / comments afterwards.
So I decided to go the extra mile for you here. I actually designed it, and I'll walk you through the process I went through.

**Design**: [link](http://imgur.com/M37PD8J)

**Process:**

* One of the most important things in a professional looking design is consistency. With that in mind, you should try and keep your margins, font-sizes, colors, and spacing consistent. My margins are not completely consistent here because it was a quick mockup, but in a final product it should be.

* I put an image in the header. An image like this, while not strictly necessary, is certainly eye candy.

* Font is important. Choose wisely. I went with a pretty common one used in web-design, but there are many others that would work as well. Honestly I think the thing I dislike about the font you choose is that it is a serif font. Just doesn't seem to work here.

* Subtle shadows can promote elements to be more important on the page. The shadows on the 3 options (although I feel I have too much shadow here) and the placement of them draws attention to them. 

* Logo. Obviously my Logo is not correct for this, but the one feels like an afterthought. This requires some thought and if you are making a serious product, would probably be a good idea to have a professional designer make, to create a solid brand identity. I normally look through Dribbble or 99 designs for some inspiration. 

* Text alignment. Text looks better when it is slightly gray (I normally just make it slightly transparent) and aligned properly. The text in my design here is justified, which normally tends to look more professional. Center aligned paragraphs of a decent length normally look horrible and are harder to read.

* Color pallette. Here I took colors from the image, but your standard red, blue, green, don't really cut it when it comes to pallette. There are multiple tools online to help you create on, but it is normally very important.

* Button style. Using the default button style is normally a poor idea. I generally just create my own. Slightly rounded corners, some padding, and letter spacing normally work well.

**Considerations**

These are just some general ideas, and the design I made is obviously. One important thing I did not do in it, that I normally would do in a professional product is sweat the details.  Some things don't quite line up properly and they should. Little things like colors and font-weights can be very important too and I didn't pay a lot of attention to them here.

This design is obviously also static. No considerations were made to make it fit on a smaller device. This is very important in web development, and I find it normally helps me to just take a pencil and paper and sketch out the 2 - 3 main screen sizes the design will be adapting too. this helps you get your head around where everything will be going and makes the actual development much easier. A common phrase used in woodworking is "measure twice, cut once". This advice applies here as well. Settle on where you want things to go before you start building it. It is far easier to make 2 or 3 quick sloppy sketches than redo all of the CSS and HTML a couple times. 

If you have any other questions feel free to ask.

Edit: I made a point of mentioning margins and I figured I would elaborate slightly more. Side margins and centering are critical. You don't want the items to get too wide. Things are much easier to read when they are closer together. This is pretty easily accomplished by putting a wrapper around each section (you probably already have, if you don't add one) and setting a max width, and margin: 0 auto, which will center it after it reaches that max with. There are some other things you can do to build on this, but its a good start.
Since you're using flex-box, try putting this property in your .container

    justify-content: space-around;

Flex-box is awesome! Here's a good article to learn all about it:
https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/

Edit: You also don't need to set everything as a flex container (display: flex). If you aren't sure about which items need it, you could always experiment by commenting it out and see if anything happens to get a feel for it, but do take a look at the article to get a better understanding of flex-box.
Really need to center things or at least use some sort of grid system (ex. bootstrap) so things line up correctly.  It's painful when everything on the page is different sizes.  This would also make your page responsive.  
You sir, you're awesome. Thank you for taking the time to do this! Not everyone takes the time and effort to do something like this, amazing.
Uh, wow. Great job on this!!! Looks amazing
Well step one would be to delete that site and start from scratch. That thing is not something updating can save. You should just pick a good host and tell him what it will cost. 

I would honestly just try to set up a wordpress site for him. You can get a decent looking template (you couldn't do worse than he has now if you tried). I think there are a few event type ecommerce plugins for wordpress that could handle the signup part. 

You didn't say if you were being paid for this but you shouldn't do this for free because it is a decent little chunk of work even if you go with templated solutions.
So, if I created a wordpress site for him and used this plugin:  https://wordpress.org/plugins/event-registration/  do you think it would work?  It seems as if this would work because it would add all of the functionality he wants in a site.  Thanks for your advice.  Let me know if you think this will work.
Yeah I think that would work. 


Hey, welcome to web dev. I've been in the industry for over 10 years having worked at startups, enterprises, mid size companies and as a consultant.

I'll try to cover all the different environments I've been in:

* Startups: depending on the size and age of the startup this varies, but generally it's fast paced with a need to get things done quick. Not a lot of red tape, and often times it's more important to get code out there than it is to do it right.

* Mid Size: Less fast paced but more hectic since you have to wear many hats and often times deal with other groups that are not tech focused.

* Large enterprises: Lots of red tape. You want a new os on your laptop, go meet with 4 different people to get approvals and another 3 to get the media to install it on your box.

* Consultant: Great gig, you're more flexible with time and make more money. But you aren't part of a team and could be cut at anytime.

These days I'm full time at a place that used to be a startup, but got bought by an larger company. We still have our startup culture though.

To answer your questions, all the web developers on our team have flexibility in terms of work hours. I get there between 10-10:30am , some people show up at 11-12noon. As long as you get your work done, no one cares. We follow scrum and work in specific cross functional teams. On a team, it's up to the folks there to decide how much they want to work together vs individual. Some weeks tasks just work out that everyone goes and does their own thing. Other weeks its more productive to work together. Management doesn't care and leaves it to developers to figure out what's best. All that matters is that at the end of the week they can show progress.

We also have a laid back culture , we have video games, nerf guns, an arcade machine, ping pong etc. Very typical tech company stuff. 

Personally I've worked in technology companies and in non-tech companies where they have in house developers (for example banks, law firms, construction companies etc). I've found that you get way more perks working tech companies since you build the product that the company is selling. In other industries, you would a service to help the main product/money maker. That means less perks and benefits. With that said, you can get a pretty chill 9-5 in non-tech companies it just won't be as fun/glamourous.

My 2 cents :)

Edit: to add more context on the work itself. We work in one week sprints. At the end of the sprint we have a retrospective/demo where we show product owners what was accomplished. Sometimes it's a page, sometimes it's a site etc. After that the team plans what to work on the next week with our product owner. (the product owner is the responsible party of the business who decides what needs to be built). Product owner is not a manager and has no authority over the team itself in terms of salaries/raises. The product owner is there to drive the focus of the team. So based on the product owner, the team figures out what it can do in a week and comes up with goals. If the product owner asks for something that can't be done in a week, the team can veto it and break it down into a smaller task.
Just a quick one - don't think of this as your learning phase. That should be the phase you're in during your entire career. 
Thanks for your post! I definitely like the sound of tech environments. A good buddy of mine is a tech recruiter and I know they have nerf guns and one of those basketball toss games so that seems neat.

What do you feel is the best setting to get into after a coding boot camp like GA? In regards to your edit, would the team work together to create 1 functioning site or everyone makes their own product and the client chooses which they like? Sorry if I'm a little lost. I really appreciated your insight!
Yeah I didn't want it to seem like I don't plan on learning as I continue through the career, just that I'm still learning the early ropes and the basics
>What do you feel is the best setting to get into after a coding boot camp like GA? 

Honestly, it would be best to get into an established tech company. I'd say work hard, learn as much as you can and have stuff to show to increase your chances. With that said, you have to take any dev job for a year or two to level up before going to an established tech company.

> In regards to your edit, would the team work together

That depends on the company and team. For us we have a couple of large web properties and teams often own parts of the site. So they would manage the front-end/back-end components of their specific feature. Some companies give an entire team a site. I worked on a team where we owned a very large, high traffic site. We were the only ones working on it. So it varies.
>edit: Also there's a junior that's gunning really hard for my job. I'm not really worried about it, because I have helped him with his homework and he can't write code, but it's concerning.

I want to hear more about this because office drama lol. Is he like shitty about it like he tries to make you look bad?? I have always worked for smaller companies where there aren't really hierarchical positions, were all just developers. There are people who are above me but it's more implied by seniority than anything.
[deleted]
Leave. Do what you love and get paid while you can.
Time for side projects!
Nothing that dire. Just a junior that took a few classes and thinks he's the next Alan Turing. It's not something I'm seriously worried about, but hearing about his attempts make my blood pressure wise.
This. Definitely ask for a raise. No harm in asking for a raise. If you're not satisfied with what you get, definitely go job hunting. 
That's a thought too, I just don't think they will be able to offer me a substantial pay raise to justify another year there. I would need to ask for a 30%+ raise, and I just can't see it happening.
Your current salary is the biggest thing that you will base your future earnings off of. Unless you have your literal dream job, I wouldn't turn down a 50% raise this early in your career. 

Now is the time to build your resume and get the big raises. It's my biggest professional regret that I stayed at one place for 5 years in my mid 20s.


Thanks for that. I just needed an 'objective' view on this and you told me exactly what I needed to hear. It's difficult to see that from my point of view, because I do things like play Borderlands with my coworkers and my boss bakes the office cookies, and so it will be hard to jump ship, but for 50% I realize that I have to.
This is correct. From a career development prospective the best time  to be aggressive with job moves is when you're younger at the start of your career.

Take risks and grow while you're still young and early on in your career. You can afford it now but maybe not when you're older and you've got family to support.
It is hard to do, but it is worth it. 

I had to do same kind of thing last year where I left good coworkers and athmosphere behind for a bit better salary and more professional environment. It was hard to leave for me too, but now after couple of months I realize that it was 100% worth it. If you want to improve, you need to make hard choices aswell, you will thank yourself later for doing it.
> What are you guys requirments for what makes a good portfolio project?

Time.

A lot of my projects are rushed (you know how it is) - and admittedly, not my best work.

Your best work shows that you took the time to put effort into it. I get that this isn't always feasible due to unrealistic deadlines, but try and make it happen. 

Usually projects with them utmost care and effort go into my portfolio.
Yeah I work as a developer now but I have a design degree so I have a hard time getting out of that mindset when I build a portfolio. I have so many projects that I want to redo the front end to something that looks really good before I use it in a portfolio.
Let's hope his prison guards don't use this site.
haha, not bad :)
awesome! lol
You don't need to prefix border radius and box shadow anymore.
Ok. Thanks for the tip!
"public_html" is unlikely to be in the url. Try removing it from the url in the font-face block.

I was able to access the font file at that url, but without the "public_html" part. (The url that worked for me was http://audiopaste.com/wp-content/themes/wp_tinos5-v1.3/fonts/playfair/PlayfairDisplay-BoldItalic.otf ). 
for the path, try this

    src: url('fonts/fontname.ext');

that is how i have the path set when using font face
That worked, thank you!
That works but it'd be better to make it relative and just use /wp-content/themes/wp_tinos5-v1.3/fonts/playfair/PlayfairDisplay-BoldItalic.otf
Sounds like a really cool thing to do. Is there any machine learning involved ?
This is almost ready: You can the development so far here:
http://www.kodhus.com/youtube-insights-experiment/
If you are asking if it is worth it as a product then i really dont know. But as a dev experience it really sounds like fun id say go for it
Wow, very cool! Personally I'd love to have access to this kind of tool. What I wonder though is if it's possible to compare a channel's sentiment to YouTube average numbers. I haven't been able to find public info like this though. 
If you got 404 Try this one: 
http://technical.nailfashionsweden.se/youtube-insights-experiment/
yes, Going to use python and NLTK.
Dont want to make a product out of it. In the company that I work for, sales team have already sold this before it even gets to be a product. It is in our roadmap but you know how it works usually, It takes like 1-2 month of development, testing , operations etc etc and then it gets to be the product. So for me, this will be a hack as a POC.
Thanks for the feedback.
I actually finished some of it. You can read about it and see the demo here: 
http://www.kodhus.com/youtube-insights-experiment/
Ahh I got a 404 when I clicked on it. 
http://technical.nailfashionsweden.se/youtube-insights-experiment/
Have you looked through configuration options on their website? That gives you the answer to pretty much all of these. Since you added the dropzone class instead of instantiating it in javascript you have to edit the Dropzone.options object just as it says in the configuration section. From there you can use any of the configuration options listed. There is one called maxFiles, dictDefaultMessage, etc. Changing the size of the dropzone you'll just need to do with CSS. Then the layout section basically gives you the code for removing a file. By the way, that big X means the file doesn't fit the requirement to be valid. It doesn't mean 'remove this file.' So it's possible it's too big or the wrong type. At least that's how it works in the demo on their site.



Love the idea, I would suggest you offer your initial library by simply signing up for the newsletter or something instead of a fee, and then if/when it takes off you throw a sub price in there for future or more detailed content. 
Go for it!

You got my attention :D
Thanks! I love this idea, I think I'll launch the first few for free when they're ready!

Aha, thanks for the tip! Will also add this to the article if it's ok with you :)
Here some things I would change:

* Higher resolution images
* A cleaner, sans-serif modern font
* Different color palette
* Keep social media icons to one color
* Maybe lay the text over the images rather than that black background
* The blog app picture is stretched weird
* Not digging all of the white space
And your layout completely breaks down in a Safari browser. All of your link images are stacked vertically and the image title is in the top left corner rather than in the middle. 

As for the about section, I think employers will care much more about your portfolio than your about section

When I click on projects, the "some of my projects" jumps out at me while everything else fades away. I'd recommend  getting rid of the black background so it isn't quite so harsh.

The main page feels a bit plain. Perhaps some kind of subtle, neutral toned, patterned background? Other than that it looks clean and I like that.
Yes, look up Nginx server blocks (virtual hosts).
Yes, it's a VPS, so each droplet is a computer that you can log into and deploy apps.

As for how: that depends on your techstack.
yes its possible I have a couple of node.js programs, an apache server, and gitlab all on one server
Let's assume I'm using nginx and I want to host multiple python apps across different domains.
I'd say docker, because that would be easy in the long run. Else just start your python app on a port and use nginx as a reverse proxy 
<input type="number" step="any" />

You may need some sort of fallback since this isn't fully supported in all browsers. http://caniuse.com/#feat=input-number
I don't know if [this](http://www.encodedna.com/2013/05/enter-only-numbers-using-jquery.htm) is helpful, but it uses jQuery to do that.

It's spam that's not actually hitting your site but targeted to trigger GA. Google "GA spam filter" to learn how to add filters to filter it out. 

Everyone that uses GA has the same problem.
I found this to be the case about half a year ago. At the time, I found a list online of domains that I could exclude from the analytics results. What I also found (and this was my case and scenario but could be different for you) but the domains appeared no where in my logs, I could not cross reference them at all in my server logs. After some more searching, apparently some of these sites spoof the GA code and that causes the results to show up in your analytics profile.
Probably a lot of them are just crawlers. Some might be probing your site to see if they can hack it. 
It's referral spam, designed to get you to 'notice' them so you visit their site. Notice how a lot of the domains have to do with SEO, analytics, traffic boosting, etc...
Thank you! I was worried at first this helps.
thanks!
Why not try and prototype it first instead of building the real thing?
What do you mean?
Create a fake version, in PowerPoint or on paper even, and user test it. I'm on mobile now but check out Eric reiss lean start up talk.

That way you get good feedback on how/what/why before spending resources on expensive development.
Anybody have any opinions on dart vs. typescript? I'm looking for something a little more structured than plain js, but not sure which of those would be the best bet.
[deleted]
Dart is like TypeScript without all of JavaScript's baggage. Dart also has a much better-thought-out, coherent ecosystem. If JS were a house, TS would be like adding a few new rooms onto the same old, junky foundation, but Dart would be like tearing it all down and building a new, modern abode.
Awesome! Check out https://dart.academy for some great tutorials.
This is super neato
This is pretty slick, however, you need to [label your axes](https://xkcd.com/833/), and I personally find it annoying that every state change affects my browser history. I enjoyed looking at some tags, either way.

I couldn't automatically tell that the height meant # of questions. make a y-axis and label it so !

- Not minifying self-hosted stuff at all
- No gzipping

From 31->17 requests, 765K -> 255K transferred, load times 0.97s->0.57s (with ad blocker enabled). Could easily be 10 times better.

Meh, did they even try?
You could also say they got dumb and didn't plan for scalable traffic.
Still a lot more optimizations they can use to scale. They need to realize a lot of markets aren't seeing the live drawing so every few months they have options to ramp up and allow people to get involved. 
Bogus jackpot, rest of the world you win what you see. Here they show before taxes amt.
Their original home page ain't even responsive or optimized for mobile: 

http://www.powerball.com/pb_home.asp
Should have base64 encoded the images and served them from within a single html page. Then pushed the page to Amazon Cloudfront.
It just blows my mind that people play the lottery more because the jackpot is bigger.  So... a tiny tiny chance at $100 million isn't worth wasting your money on, but at $800 million, then it's worth it?

There are so many kinds of faulty logic in that, I can't even begin to understand it.  Things like this make me realize that the way my brain works is not the same as much of the rest of the world.

**Edit:**  That last sentence is supposed to mean that I'm realizing that I think differently than some people.  I'm not saying people are dumb for playing the lottery when it's high.  I'm just saying it's not logical, and personally I don't get it (aside from the social reasons mentioned by mattindustries).  And apparently the downvoting of this point of view is just a /r/webdev thing, since [others](https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/401t4v/powerball_jackpot_hits_800m_largest_us_lottery/cyqvfam) have said the same thing and got upvoted for it.
Isn't the scalable cloud a good solution for this use-case? I guess they just own the servers phisically and makes no sense to pay some external company.
Considering the rest of their job is to spend 30 seconds twice a week playing with ping pong balls, I'd say the right amount of effort was spent here.
How do you think it got as high as it has ;)
No. You don't know what you're talking about. All they had to do was minify their CSS and this all could have been avoided. /s
> Protip, you'll need at least the $10/mo DO instance. /s

You mean I can't do this on my shared HostGator account??  I'll prove you wrong, I can scale out to 100 trillion users per second on my $3 a month plan!!  I'll optimize all the CSS with Javascript!  Bwahahah!
I get 300 hits a day... I feel good about that.
There's clearly some basic practices that a "CSS monkey" would know that's not even implemented on this site, so why don't you step off your little high horse and contribute instead of adding to the noise. 
> Loading jQuery, from http://code.jquery.com
> Loading Bootstrap AND a Bootstrap theme

Both from CDNs, won't hit their server.

>Not minifying self-hosted stuff at all

The only thing self-hosted is their [css file](http://www.powerball.com/css/landing.css). Minifying does get a 41% reduction, but that's only 865 bytes.

>No gzipping

Fair criticism.

In any case they've been doing this for years now, it's not actually new like OP says. Not sure how many years, but it's possible all these optimizations weren't even popular when they implemented this. Their website *is* built with [asp](http://www.powerball.com/pb_home.asp) after all.
My favorite part:

> Cross browser Marquee script- ï¿½ Dynamic Drive (www.dynamicdrive.com)

unneeded tbh. this is the easiest solution
haha yea true
they could have just thrown something like CloudFlare in front of it and gained instant caching depending on their setup.
Yeah it would totally suck to get something like 400 million.

A very big french website for p2p sell/buy, [leboncoin](http://www.leboncoin.fr/annonces/offres/ile_de_france/), has a crappy unresponsive design direct from the year 2000.

It actually tried multiple times shinny modern designs, but when ab testing them they discover people hated them : they were too used to the original design.

And thus the website keeps it's crappy design. I can easily see the same thing happening to powerball.
If someone hits reload, that burns a lot more bandwidth than just the html.
> Things like this make me realize that the way my brain works is not the same as much of the rest of the world.

You're right. Most people in the world aren't annoying twats.
I can explain it better if you are having trouble understanding. Say we played a coin flip game. Heads I win, tails you win. If you win, I keep the $2 entry fee, but if you win you get $2. You might say, "meh" to that, but now what if you won you got $800 million? 

Not to mention the water cooler talk you are now included in, as well as something to unite your friends and family to rally behind. As far as wasting money, for many $2 doesn't even register. That is a fraction of what I give the pizza delivery person for a tip. I don't even play, but at least I can see the appeal.
you're like, so smart and unique!!!!~!~!~
What they did is perfect.  

99% of the traffic is probably just to see exactly what they have up there now. I'm sure it would be a huge waste of resources to scale up just to show the powerball numbers. 
With aws elb's you can serve a static site hosted in an s3 bucket as a fallback when your main sites go down. I feel that's what they should've done from the beginning.
To be fair, gzipping incurs server load. Often DOS is caused by insufficient CPU cycles rather than insufficient bandwidth. So there's at least a possibility that it's intentional.
How does gzipping apply to serving webpages?
If the CSS so small maybe inlining it would be better rather than extra request. 
> Both from CDNs, won't hit their server.

Sure, my point was that they don't even really need Bootstrap nor jQuery on that simplified landing page.

>The only thing self-hosted is their css file. Minifying does get a 41% reduction, but that's only 865 bytes.

You forgot the HTML.

This was definitely not done to improve load times on clients, but reduce stress on the backend. So I guess, job.. done?
Of all the people here recommending to gzip...how many of you actively implement a defense against BREACH?

Here, I'll save you from a Google search. 

http://www.infoworld.com/article/2611658/data-security/how-to-defend-your-web-apps-against-the-new-breach-attack.html

Nostalgia alert!
Agreed. Their "splash page" is fast, extremely low cost, gives the majority of the users exactly what they came for, and just works. This is brilliant in it's simplicity compared to just throwing more money at the problem.
No, because CloudFlare takes time to switch DNS. Sure their TTL is low now, but we don't know what it was during the time they needed to come up with a quick fix.
That is not the point, it should be what you see is what you get. Government is already making 3x of the jackpot from lottery sales. So if I understand this correctly they cut 400 million because you pick cash payout vs annuity. Then from 400 you also pay taxes which is about 1/3. So you will be getting if there are no other winners about 266. There is a huge difference between what is advertised vs what you get. Anyways...Not that I play the lottery...
Thanks for mentioning this. Not everyone wants or needs a responsive mobile-first single-page javascript-monster site. What's more important IMO is to make an interface that doesn't get in your users' way
As far as the first part of your comment, I'm not sure if you're just joking or not, but the point is if your motivation is to get rich, $100 million should be enough incentive.  We're not talking about $2.

I think logic just doesn't come into it.  Some people do it for the social value that you mention because there's more hype and people talking about it when the jackpot is unusually high since that's a relatively rare event (the actual amount of money doesn't matter, just that it's an unusual event).  But for most people, it's just one of the examples of how people are emotionally motivated to do things that are actually irrational.  There isn't a logical money-based reason why a non-millionaire should play the lottery at $800 million, but not at $100 million.
He's probably a really nice guy too. That's why girls don't like him.
As long as they can automate the process I'm fine with what they are doing right now :p 
You can gzip the file in advance. You can also instruct your server to cache the gzipped file. More importantly though, if you're only serving a static page, you should be serving it from a CDN where the gzipping CPU time is not your problem.
If you're serving only static content, you can also serve pre-gzipped files. More info: http://css-ig.net/articles/pre-compression-gzip
This. If load is heavy, the goal is to use as little effort as possible to serve content 
[See here](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/optimizing-content-efficiency/optimize-encoding-and-transfer?hl=en). The [vast majority](http://webmasters.stackexchange.com/questions/22217/which-browsers-handle-content-encoding-gzip-and-which-of-them-has-any-special) of browsers support unzipping webpages on the fly, so your server can gzip assets to reduce transfer size.
Server gzips prior to sending, client un-gzips upon receiving.
Serve the web pages compressed with gzip.
> You forgot the HTML.

Good point. That'll reduce it from 5.3kB to 3.3kB.

>This was definitely not done to improve load times on clients, but reduce stress on the backend. So I guess, job.. done?

Yeah, I thought that was the idea. Their server couldn't handle the stress of the traffic during big jackpots so they minimize server load with a small static page, letting them still get the results out without the site crashing. I doubt they considered client-side bloat an issue at all.
Not really a concern for a static site though.
Managers...
Yeah man that really drives the point home, 200+ million would totally suck.
Nobody's talking about a JavaScript SPA monster site. We have learned a hell of a lot of UI/UX in the last 10 years. A lot of that can be applied to these old-ass designs to bring them up-to-date while _enhancing_ usability, in my opinion.
>I'm not sure if you're just joking or not, but the point is if your motivation is to get rich, $100 million should be enough incentive. We're not talking about $2.

So, I would love this citation that most don't enjoy the game/anticipation/social aspect unless you are just drawing irrational conclusions.

Also, I think your scaling of risk vs. reward logic is broken, since you aren't grasping the scaled down version. I can think of a lot of things I can do with $800 million that I can't do with $100 million. [Heck, I couldn't even buy this house, let alone pay taxes on it for $100 million](http://www.realtor.com/realestateandhomes-detail/788-Tortuoso-Way_Los-Angeles_CA_90077_M26294-04823).
All solutions which can't really be implemented in an emergency.
Sure, but in an emergency should you really try to implement brand new ways to serve everything?
I was working with some Node fetching and didn't realize I was being sent back a gzipped page which is why my code fell apart at that moment. The script hit a few different servers putting things together for me, but only one did gzip (and I think mandatory). 
I'd guess you're right...and as long as the page loads in a reasonable amount of time, who cares?

Realistically, the savings gained by ditching jQuery and Bootstap would be negligible;  I think it's fair to assume that most people will have both cached (I would probably use Google's CDN, but whatever).
True, but it depends on your audience whether that is necessary or even desirable. My audience includes a lot of older people who learn to use the site basically by muscle memory. The second a button moves or a process changes, you get hundreds of support tickets saying the site is broken. A sophisticated user may be able to absorb all the iterative UI tweaks that are the norm these days, but it pays to be careful.
Though I believe the powerball team implement solution that is "good enough" and serves its purpose, and that everyone else that is criticism them is just...noise...the powerball team should have encountered this before and this should not be an emergency fix. 

They've probably loaded tested (I hope) and know what kind of performance their solution can handle and said, meh, it works, let's go home. 
It's actually a pretty easy process and far from a "brand new" approach. You could probably get from not knowing anything about it to having it implemented in production in under an hour.

However, since the current solution is still far from minimal (the next step would be minimizing the resources, and then gzipping them), I'm guessing they reached a point where it's good enough and don't really want to tinker with what already works.
Totally agree. The reason I'm defending their current workaround is because the subject of this post is their innovative reaction in an emergency situation, rather than their forethought or planning. 
My point was that when fires are being put out it's much easier to just disable gzip than implement this solution, and provided the issue is CPU bandwidth rather than network bandwidth it solves the issue until they can come back and improve it.
Is this 2009?
[We got one new one](http://devleaks.com/link/building-web-apps-in-python-3-with-flask)

cmon y'all!!  

Add them blogs!
Thanks so much guys, we got a bunch rolling in now :-)
Are you looking for blogs or blog posts?  Here's mine. http://blog.aaronholmes.net/
Suggestion: allow submitters to add their own tags.
Also, if you'd rather just browse and collect favorites (click the little star), you can do that too.  For example, here are all the ones I favorited

http://devleaks.com/user/devleaks 
Blogs and blog posts are all welcome, as long as it is Web Dev related
that's a valid suggestion, and I did think about that.  My only concern was that people might go tag crazy and try to apply too many tags.  I may change that, we'll see
Do I submit a blog the same way I submit a post?
I don't think there's anything wrong with that, personally. If people don't try to keep tags grouped with other posts, their own posts will got lost in the abyss. I think that alone is incentive for posters to try to stay within the existing tags.

Some I noticed that are missing: .net, asp.net, C#, various editor and IDE names, gulp, grunt, webpack, etc, typescript, javascript, accessibility, internationalization, browser names, testing frameworks, other framework names.
Yep same way

http://blog.com

or 

http://blog.com/a-blog-post

both will work
great suggestions, I will add those tags to the database so people can use them - thanks
Anyone here will probably advise you to create something for yourself! Make yourself a blog where you can write about what you've learnt or what problems you encountered etc and how you overcame them?  Or make an 'e-resumÃ¨' website to showcase your skills as you learn them? As you get better, upgrade that website and keep track of those changes (screenshots etc). You can then link to your website on your applications.  Or do both if you're really up for a challenge. Make a blog and write about making your resumÃ¨. Include screenshots and small write-ups about what you changed and what new things you learnt that were implemented into it.
I would assume that most people on here are capable of doing things themselves. If I was you I would try ask friends or family members. Or just create websites for fictional companies.
Find associations with crappy websites and offer them a new website. That's what i did for my first website its a great way to gain experience and help someone else. Plus you will gain experience with clients.
Or check other subs you are a fan of. Lots of subs need dedicated CSS work  for formatting. 
awesome ty guys so much for the advice, i am currently working on my own website ( with a bunch of fictional stuff on it right now ) 

one question i do have tho is.. do you think it'd be hard to do 2 things at once? because i do love graphic design but i would like to learn this as well, is there a possibility at doing both?
I agree with what most people are saying to go out and do something for yourself. However, when I was starting web development I had a really hard time getting inspiration and pushing my boundaries. I used a website called [99designs.com](http://99designs.com/). It really helped me get into the mindset of dealing with clients and even though none of my designs were chosen, I did build a decent enough portfolio to present to a company in order to get hired.
I do web design/dev and music production, as well as a little graphic design every now and then. Depends what I feel like doing at the time.

Having multiple hobbies(?) isn't a problem, it's a blessing. If you're bored of one thing, just do another. Get bored of that? Go back to the first thing, or try something else entirely!

Graphic design and web design do kind of fall hand in hand, so they're both good to know together, and I recommend you subscribe to /r/web_design if you haven't already.
i'm trying so hard to make my "work from home" dream a reality, i'm only 18 and i'm in college 4 days a week but any tips on how to get started are very much appreciated.


i figured i'd come on here and r/freedesign to see if i couldn't build myself a little portfolio before going places like guru/elance etc..
If you want a little experience, you could write up your own portfolio, or find some fictional company and do a website for it! (I did one for a radio station on GTA)

Working from home is everyone's dream, I'm sure lol. I'd love to.
I'm certain Microsoft makes hideous icons for the Mac as a joke.
I'd be down with the Windows version's (Visual Studio 2015.5) app icon. But as far as the VS Code default goes, absolutely it's too big!
Did you look on dribbble for a replacement icon? Because I'm using VSCode too and I [found](https://dribbble.com/shots/2361420-Visual-Studio-Code-Icon) a pretty cool one over there. (It's not from me!)
I have a site that gets 5k uniques/day, mostly US traffic.

What are you looking to advertise ?
What kind of website is it?
Hey, that sound neat! Is your site visited by web developers? I'm planning to make some tutorials soon about [our web server](https://www.shimmercat.com), and we are looking for some advertising spots.
PM'd
Yes, we have a lot of technology,nerdy,hacking,IT, etc. related wallpapers.

Very interesting tool!
So the new courses on edX are free, but the certifications costs $129 and $99. I have wondered for some time now, is that certification any good? I mean does it really change people's minds when you show them your online certifications or your badges?
These kind of certs are pointless.  You can trash them all but you do need a nice portfolio to fall back on.

Yeah that's the way I see it too. If you have a portfolio, they are pointless.

But I am interested to see if one of the 150K people who did the first HTML5 certificate, if any of them scored a job because of it.
Most of the time it's about showing your work. Like you say, it depends on how many applicants they get and whether or not most of them complete the challenge. 

Sometimes in rare cases, seeing how people fail is just another part of the test.

I'd say there's still a chance, you'll just have to wait it out and see. 
This will vary by company, and, if the company is smart, position and demand. If they have 20 people that can do it flawlessly, well you're probably out of luck. If they have zero candidates that can do it, you're set. Just keep up with the hiring process and see how it goes, the only way it will definitely not work out is if you quit on it. 

I sometimes give programming tests for my company, and had an apparently well qualified candidate panic bail on a simple test recently. Had they stuck with it calmly, even if they hadn't gotten much further, they probably would have been fine for the next step in the hiring process given their existing code portfolio. The panic quit was a dealbreaker for us though, so it didn't work out (we deal with some more stressful situations than other programming jobs; can't have people bailing on uncomfortable situations).
It depends a lot. I once got a job despite not completing a coding exercise because my methodology up to the point when time ran out was good - the interviewer said "We could see what you were going to do".

However, apparently the other candidates weren't particularly strong (apparently I was the only one with any social skills and they took that into account) and that's the other important thing. You don't need to run faster than the bear, you just need to run faster than the other campers.
We try to look at the thought process our potential developers go through when tackling a problem.  I'd rather see someone come up with a creative way to solve it and fail, than stumble into a solution that passes all the test cases.
Coding challenges aren't solely about efficiency and correctness, they're also about examining your thought process and coding style.
It isn't the sole factor usually, we have hired excellent programmers that haven't passed tests. Sometimes people panic on tests or are just not suited for that environment, or maybe they just didn't know the specific case the test followed. We simply use it as one point of data in our process. 

We also don't do 4hr tests either though, that seems much too long and silly to me. If you want a long sample, get people to submit code samples, post their github etc.
Either one will do the job. If you know one of those already, use it as it will save you time, which means faster Minimum Viable Product.  
I love how there is a 20% chance of getting an over-flavored chip, just like in a normal bag :)
So, are you saying that it's â€¦ nacho code?
I think it's actually a crown. See:

http://www.wowhead.com/item=31272/crown-of-endless-knowledge

Except, it's the crown of endless cheesy goodness.


Lol! Yes!
Looks good, I get an underscore come up alongside each of the icons in the header when I hover over them...

Also not crazy about the font for the logo but that's a personal thing.

The background image seems to be cut off halfway across too? 
Here's my user feedback.  Take it how you will. 
* The login icon and the why vplan icon were not immediately clear to me.  I had to click on them to realize what they did.  
* On mouseover the icons get an underline next to them.  
* Who's the lady?  Might it be better to go with a plain background?  The background also doesn't fit all that well as it leaves a big white area below on both mobile and desktop.  
* Does the title font have any significance?  It looks weird. 
* Having the bullets on the why vplan page pop up one at a time is annoying.  I want to see them all at once and not wait for an extra 15 seconds.  
* Selecting appointment date on the make appoint with is weird.  I think it'd be better to have date with time slot below instead of breaking it into 3 steps (select date, select hour, select half hour). 
* There's no need to abbreviate number to "no."  
* You don't have any validation on the contact no as it allowed me to book with "23456" as the number.
* You can book multiple bookings to the same time slot
You should check this out - https://www.reddit.com/r/web_design/comments/4016l7/feedback_friday_january_08_2016
I love the look of the website. It's very clean. 

Here are my criticisms. 

* The login and Why Vplan icons weren't very intuitive. 

* the VPlan.In logo is hideous. 

* The Yellow highlighting on the Why Vplan page is ugly. 

* The hoverover change on the VPlan page should go over the line instead of replacing it. 

* Think about using a white vignette on the background image so that it blends with the blank white better. 

* Validation on contact info. 

* I like the date selection, but I don't like how it pops out to the side. 

I would like to see some sort of footer instead of a bunch of white space at the bottom. I think the styling on the logo itself could really use a major overhaul. It doesn't match the site at all. If it's a site dealing with healthcare/doctors I want something professional/trustworthy looking. The color scheme could also use a bit of work. Orange screams and yanks the eye to the top. You want to control where the user looks and right now things are kind of jumbled at the top. The picture of the woman is facing to the right and is placed at the right edge. I want her to be placed at the left, facing right so my eye goes from top left to bottom right.
A couple of things...

* The logo is hideous and it doesn't seem to fit the theme of the site
* There's white space at the bottom of the front page that needs to be gotten rid of (I can scroll down a little for no reason too)
1. Did the tooltips not help?

2. Not sure why the underline shows up on hover. Will check.

3. Lady is some image I got off a free theme :-)

4. Multiple bookings per time slot are allowed. You can specify how many in the settings page.

5. Thank you for your comments. Will fix what I can.
Cool. Thank you.
Thank you.

1. I have tooltips for the menu icons. Did that not help?

2. Without the Yellow highlighting, the text disappears into the image (on a smartphone).

3. I don't understand the hover over problem. Can you explain?
 
1. It did, but you don't want your user to have to look through tooltips. The icons should immediately convey their purpose.

2. Well then, you should fix that issue some other way. The Highlighting looks awful. (Is the smartphone rendering the text behind the image?) (Maybe you should just get rid of the image. It's kind of weird anyway)

3. When you hover over "How it works" there is white space between the colored block that pops up and the line that the block should be sitting on. 
Re #3. Could this be a browser/platform issue? On chrome version 47/linux, it seems fine
if only it were so easy :(
So true
Change `<br />`

To `echo "<br />";`
Possible solutions.

separate PHP and HTML

    <?php echo $_POST['t1']; ?>
    <br />
    <?php echo $_POST['t2']; ?>

Append

    <?php echo $_POST['t1'] . '<br />' . $_POST['t2']; ?>

Append with short tags

As in this?:

<?php 

echo $_POST["t1"];

 echo "<br />"; 

echo $_POST["t2"]; ?>
It did work in fixing the Error 500 message, Thank You! For some reason I can't get the t2 to post? Thanks buddy for that!
Yeah
No worries, my answers are basically the same as /u/jdf2's but in different formats. Its nice to have options.

Looking at your HTML its structured wrong, you have a *</div>* right after you open your form. Remove that and the form should post properly :)
Is t2 being sent?  Check your html tags and make sure the name is correct.
Hmm I can't tell you if it worked just yet, I can't seem to get t2 to post. However at least it is not telling me Server Error 500! Thank you!
Correcto mundo! It worked, thanks pal!
I sorted it out there, turned out to be an issue with the HTML. So satisfied it's fixed now. Thanks pal!
Sweet, glad i could help :)
Also, input doesn't have an ending tag, it's a void element and would look like: 
<input type="text" name="blah" />
I didn't know that. My HTML needs a bit of brushing up in general. Thanks!
Modernizr does make it easy to detect features so you can enable or disable them on supported devices. When you do nothing with the information it provides it is kinda useless to implement and only provides overhead as it a blocking resource. 
You should always try to includes a custom version of modernizr that only includes the tests you need. 
> but are they necessary today?  

Depends. What are the browser usage stats that you're developing for? Are you targeting a specific ( insert anything really. age group/ country/ different areas of work, study, techincial know how. its a rather large list sometimes haha)  

> Is browser support good enough that I don't have to worry too much about legacy browsers?  

This also ties into my first paragraph. If the stats say "20% users use IE 10/9/8, old opera, old safari" then it may be necessary depending on what exactly you are using to build your site. which is where [caniuse](http://caniuse.com) comes into play giving you browser support.   

>  If it still sucks, are there any tools you use that makes supporting them easier?  

[Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer)  
[Caniuse](http://caniuse.com)  
[Pleeease.io - can be use with build tools of choice too](http://pleeease.io/)  

Those are just three that probably most people will mention.    

> I haven't seen any modern browsers use conditional IE classes  

haha again i feel like im beating some weird drum haha sorry .. visitor usage stats. If you have old IE then they use conditional classes.   
 
But even if you aren't going for old browsers Modernizr can be useful. For instance say you want to use [CSS Snappoints](http://caniuse.com/css-snappoints) Browser support right now is terrible or [CSS Font Loading](http://caniuse.com/#feat=font-loading). You can detect it with modernizr and use it on browsers that support it.  

You can use it for many things. not just CSS. Keyboard events, Different compression algorithms (brotli), new cool things like Client Hints, New JavaScript goodies. So yeah depending on how you build your site, who your target audience is and your browser support Modernizr could be very beneficial! 

It all depends on what you need to support for your users
Tailoring support to visitor usage stats seems to be the general consensus. I don't have any stats to use, but it seems pretty straightforward to draw conclusions from some [general statistics](http://www.w3counter.com/globalstats.php). Considering I'm just making a portfolio site I can probably assume most of the users are using updated browsers. 

Thanks for the links to additional resources, I appreciate it. Autoprefixer looks like a lifesaver.
I worked at a company that had 200+ front-end developers on staff where everybody had to play by these rules:

1. Be on time for meetings;
2. Your work is great;
3. You are not impeding others.

No time limits. Everybody got paid for 40hrs of work. Most people came into the office around 10am, left around 5pm. Some worked from home a lot. Some left at 3pm when the weather was nice out.

I've seen people work from 08:00 until 18:00 and you'd wonder what they've been up to. And I've seen people work 4 hour work days that got so much shit done that you'd wonder if their brains aren't burning up.

Just a fun tidbit: A friend's employer is giving their employees *unlimited paid holidays*. Legally, anyone gets 25 anyway. And if they need 40, they can take it. Take less than 25? End of year: you'll get your remaining days paid out in full.

Similar rules apply: don't mess up.

It seems to work marvelously.
I already work whenever I feel like it. Some days I get a good 3 hours in and then just do email/ admin stuff. Other days I get in a flow state and code for 10 hours. Other days I grumble and work late because shit broke.

Ultimately my company pays me to deliver solutions, and I do that as I see fit. They don't care how many hours I put in, or when I put them in, as long as my solutions are delivered on time and in budget.
I will get same amount of work done as an 8h work day but will be happier, healthier and stay with the company longer. 
Honestly speaking. What comes to web development in general, it's the results which do matter - not the time you spend in the office. I get paid to build websites so as long I do deliver the results, I don't see any problem with six-hour working days.
I personally would be fine with this. I normally only get 4 hours of hardcore work anyway, and I think the wasted time would get chopped off first.  
  
What would help more would be hours shifting. I am not a morning person, and it seems generally most people hate getting to work at 8 or even 9. I would be much happier working 10-7 I think.
My office has 'core hours' - but even those are pretty flexible, mostly to make it easier to try and arrange meetings knowing that most people will be in sometime between 10am-4pm. 

We are salary, not hourly. The main concern is that - do we get things done? do we do it well?

We don't get micromanaged, we don't log time against tasks, on paper it's a '7.5h' work day - but in reality, it varies. 

The management also understands that devs can be odd creatures, and have their own productive-sweetspots. 

If you can prove that you are reliable/dependable and get things done when they need to get done - they don't care if it's during the work day, or if you slept all day and cranked it out over night because that's when you work best.
We really should be talking about moving to a 6 *day* work week, with multiple, active personal projects required for *any* type of employment (even non-paid internships). We need to be working more, not less. After all, [we're changing the world](http://www2.pcmag.com/media/images/199885-8-zit-picker-by-candywriter.jpg).
I would be careful with unlimited vacation, I've read about several cases of it doing the opposite. https://medium.com/triggertrap-playbook/how-our-unlimited-holiday-allowance-backfired-ac6918e6c599

Workplaces that are not governed by explicit rules/hierarchies tend to become governed by implicit ones.
I know of one one major telecommunications company in Canada that has a somewhat similar model for its IT division. Basically, get your work done model. If you want to work from home, fine. Maybe try and come in once or twice a week though.
The reason we can't apply this idea in my office is because web development is just one department of many. There are people, like help support, reception, IT, etc.. that must be present the whole day for the customers, so management would never gives us more flexibility then them. They would say it's not fair and could create jealousy and morale issues. So everyone follows the same rules, ass on seat 8h30am to 5pm.

What I try to do is work on important items when I'm alert. Then when I'm too tired I'll peruse the bug list on redmine and find something I "want" to work on, instead of "have" to work on, even if it's low priority.
This is sarcasm right? I can't tell. 
Bell? They put a lot of money into mental health research; maybe they put some of that research into practice in the workplace.
Yes, this is a similar problem I had. Mine was a trucking company so most of the departments were business, marketing or sales related and they can't make an exception to any one department. It also extended to bonuses, holidays benefits, etc.
As awesome as Chrome's UA Spoofer plugin is to simulate mobile/tablet devices nothing beats the real thing. Recently I found a major bug on my tablet that worked just fine when simulating it on my desktop.
Chrome and Firebug mobile device emulators are fine for me. These tools are able to spot most of the bugs.
I have a Nexus 7 and iPod Touch I use for this, personally.
Chrome/Opera's emulator, and my good ol' Nexus 5.
We have;

Old android device
Ipad
Iphone 4s
Chrome dev tools emulators
Android emulators
Ios simulator

We are planning to widen our range of devices, there are things like android device farm but nothing bests the real thing
Yea what got me into thinking this was the Safari responsive mode post. It has IE mode but flexbox works in IE8, apparently :)

The only problem i have with devices is thinking i'll need:

* Android mobile (Potentially a few for alternate versions?)
* Android tablet
* ios mobile (ios7, 8, 9?)
* ios tablet

* ie9 laptop
* ie10 laptop
* ie11 laptop
* edge laptop
Do you ever use a browsers responsive mode and notice things that the devices pick up that the browser doesn't?
You'll want to add large (1600px+) desktop, small (800x600?) desktop, and retina/UHD (4k) to that ;)

Just kidding, but honestly I think the best (as well as easiest and cheapest) way is just to use the browser emulator and any devices you already have lying around.
For all the IEs you don't need any hardware, check out https://dev.windows.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/vms/windows/

Just a beefy workstation to run the virtual machines.

Edit: Btw, you can install all IE VMs with this script: https://github.com/xdissent/ievms
The primary issue isn't so much with what the browser picks up, but differences in iOS Safari and the very popular Dolphin browsers. They sometimes have little (major) quirks that need dealing with.
That's true, do you know if the Xcode ios simulator is sufficient enough to replicate them?
I would not trust a simulator, personally.

I don't think it would be possible without recreating the whole thing. You could try to set the cursor as a click-through element, and having a transparent HTML form/text box underneath it to type commands into, but that's the only way I can think of.
Check out browserify, way easier to set up. A good start is googling for a decent browserify + babel gulpfile and build on it as you need.
preface: from the very brief description you have given, I don't think you need Webpack. I'm relatively new to Webpack myself, but my impression is that Webpack is for large, Javascript heavy projects. If the Javascript you are writing is minimal enough that you wouldn't benefit from a framework, I don't think you need Webpack. 


Coming from the Angular world, I had never used Webpack and I only started because of React. I had a similar experience (confused) approaching Webpack but ultimately what got me running was bouncing around in the following resources:

- [http://christianalfoni.github.io/javascript/2014/12/13/did-you-know-webpack-and-react-is-awesome.html](http://christianalfoni.github.io/javascript/2014/12/13/did-you-know-webpack-and-react-is-awesome.html)

- [https://github.com/christianalfoni/webpack-express-boilerplate](https://github.com/christianalfoni/webpack-express-boilerplate)

- [https://github.com/webpack/webpack/tree/master/examples](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/tree/master/examples)

The first link there is probably the best to start out with. It goes step by step and explains. After that point, looking around at the examples should help you generalize for your needs. 
Thanks you. Browserify ended up working great with babelify in the end. I think I've built a really solid gulp file now. Was just confusing myself with webpack. 
My opinion here but after looking for the same thing my conclusion is that there is no real good free ui component suite that will have everything you need to write robust apps. They're always missing some critical control or framework incompatibility. And I really want my project to look and feel consistent. I always end up back at kendo. If you really believe you can monetize your app should just fork over the cash and get the tooling that's appropriate. Kendo has free edition too that seems comparable to the free ones out there.
This http://stackoverflow.com/questions/200284/what-are-alternatives-to-extjs may help. Also, check the awesome w2ui. Looks dated, but it is very good .
Well, I think the main in ExtJS is grid.

I know some much cheaper solution than ExtJS about grid.  
It is FancyGrid - http://fancygrid.com  
FancyGrid is JavaScript grid library with charts integration and server communication.
Which kendo version do you think offers more for the money?
First look at the controls you suspect you will need. You might just get away with the free one. If you need the paid one then if you just need the js stuff then go pro. If you want the MVC razor wrappers and all that then you're going to go to more expensive version. Also, the kendo stuff totally supports angular and typescript.
> was taken down due to a WHOIS issue earlier this morning

Do you mean a DNS issue?  What was the issue?

Site loads fine for me, but if you're talking about an issue with DNS propagation it could take up to several days for it to completely resolve itself (depends on many factors, including where caching is occurring, whether or not various points in that chain are observing the TTL as they should, etc.).

Knowing more about what the underlying issue actually was might help someone inform you on what to expect.  How is DNS handled for the domain?
Site is loading in the UK, bit slow, but its working.
Sorry I should of been more clearer. The DNS has not been changed in anyway as far as I know, the issue was that for whatever reason Mediatemple wasn't happy with the WHOIS Info and replaced the website with a splash image saying "call our support". 

The main email connected to the domain was the Clients so of course they ignored it until the site was actually taken down. 

It shouldn't be the propagation, it's showing that it's propagated here but of course it's possible. 

If there's anymore information that you think would be helpful please let me know and I'll edit the main post.


At least it's loading somewhat, haha. Thanks for checking it :)
> Mediatemple wasn't happy with the WHOIS Info and replaced the website with a splash image saying "call our support".

They did this through a DNS change.  They didn't change the files on your site directly (I assume).

As such, the DNS change back will take time to propagate.  If you're still having the issue in 48 hours, I'd be surprised.
Ahh ok, I should of figured. Isn't it weird that out of every country it's Australia (where the sites customers are) that is taking longer to propagate?
> Isn't it weird that out of every country it's Australia (where the sites customers are) that is taking longer to propagate?

Not necessarily, those are probably the various places that were most likely to cache the "bogus" DNS response during the downtime when the Mediatemple redirected it.  As such, they'll likely cling to the changed values at least for the duration of whatever TTL was set with those modified DNS entries (possibly longer, if they choose to ignore it).
> Isn't it weird that out of every country it's Australia 

It's not "Australia".

Telstra has long, for cost cutting reasons that made sense in the 90's, overridden DNS TTLs and inserted their own, which usually run for 96 hours. Advise to reduce TTLs will not help you. You will just need to wait this out.

For what it's worth, I can confirm that, from a different Australian ISP, the site is working fine.
Phew, at least it's not something major then. Literally everyone I spoke to was blaming my ISP. I'm glad it's just still propagating. I'll defiantly be lowering the TTL.

Thanks for clearing that all up for me! I was pulling my hair out with this one. 
I can also view it from Uecomm
I feel like every day there is another reason to hate Telstra more. You're right, it is 96 hours when I spoke to them again.

Yea I'll defiantly be waiting over the weekend so hopefully it's all good by Monday. 

I defiantly have a better understanding of DNS after all of this, I didn't realise before most IPS's control the TTL. 
> I'll defiantly be lowering the TTL.

Unfortunately, that won't do you any good in this instance (or in any other instance like this where the DNS change is out of your control) since that change has already happened and the TTL on whatever change they made wasn't dictated by your settings (it's whatever they set it to be when they made the change).
Oh defiantly, I understood that much I just meant for going forward. From what I now understand the TTL has been set by the ISP anyway so it wouldn't of made much of a difference. 
What?
And they will all be outdated in 2 months.
I just went trough the same js-ecosystem bullshit myself last week. It is [fucking insane](https://github.com/WesleyE/attribute_software/blob/master/client/package.json). 
It works great and fast when you've set everything up, but making sure everything fits together and holds up after a couple of months just takes to much time.
We really need people to start working together instead of building something completely new every couple of months.
[deleted]
That's just what I needed. More fucking tools!
Depedency hell...
Too much shit! I hope this is satire, but then again I know some devs that do this with whatever new bling-bling gets released.
Not enough dependencies
Why the butthurt in comments? These are tools for TDD and CI. They're essential when working in a team on a large apps where code changes rapidly while app must remain stable and not affect the user.

Yes it's complicated, but that's what we currently have.
He owns a mac.
Not before they all take turns making breaking changes each week.
The same thoughts went through my head and had to visit the comments to find out. Nope, not a joke.
I wish. Ive barely  had the time to actually write the tests myself. This is the only state of affairs I've ever known as I'm a new student of web development. It would be interesting to know how others like yourself do it.
"if you learn to set this up once, youâ€™ll be able to replicate this for your future projects with a single click. " Until a few weeks when the latest batch of "the coolest tools this month" is released. I think this is the point.... rather than whether TDD/whatever is good or not for dev teams.
I'd be interested. Went to college to go to law school and after working at law firms for a couple of years, decided I hated it. Finished my degree and went back for a computer science degree. Have worked for a startup backed by Google, then a late advertising company where I developed sites for Disney, NASA, EA games, ATT, etc. now work for a fortune 50 company as a senior UI developer. I do full stack development on the side where I have cofounded a company, do fun projects contributing to GitHub repos, and I mentor at a local development program funded by the city which helped influence the president to visit. I programmed my first application when I was 13 in TI-basic on my TI-83 during class. 

I love what I do, I love talking about what I do, and I would recommend it to anyone who is interested. I only regret not deciding it would be my professional calling at a younger age.
I'm not one of these fancy Googley commenters, but I am an interface developer (not really any design work in my job, though, if that's more what she's looking for--I work closely with designers and write front-end code) and it's exciting to me to hear about your sister because I'm a female developer and I also started learning to code around her age (I'm 25 now). If there's anything I can answer, I'd be happy to.
I would love to if you need anybody else!

I haven't worked for anybody fancy like Google, but I'm a female designer / developer who's done the UI design for a few kids apps and a couple of apps for Australian TV shows, and worked on a couple of apps for BBC TV shows too.

I've also recently finished doing the design + front end dev for a text based game using IBM's Watson. And am currently working on my own mobile app using Cordova where you put hats on cats. :)

Looks like you've already got a lot of people wanting to answer, but if your sister wanted a female perspective I'm happy to answer any questions!
I would like to help.
I was gonna volunteer, but then I saw the comments. Google Associates beat me.
Senior UI Engineer here for eBay. I've also worked at Apple, and other tech companies, as well as consulting. I have my own interesting path to how I got here as well, including dropping out of college after 6.5 years.

If she has some questions to send my way or something, I'd be happy to help out. 
My friend/old boss does UI at Google, I can see if she's interested if you want! Just PM me. 
Using a throwaway but I'd be glad to talk as well if she needs another datapoint.

I have a CS background, and I've worked as a product designer at Facebook and Palantir in Seattle and Palo Alto respectively. 

At Facebook I worked on their enterprise ads platform and at Palantir I've worked on software to run an energy company, a system to keep track of a piece of data's history, and a humanitarian project in a conflict zone. 

I wrote a lot of code at Palantir, no code at Facebook. 
Most of my experience has been UI work. I'd love to help.
I'm a Sr UI Designer at a fairly well known game studio. I can't program at all though :)
Not stealing from the top comment in the least, just providing my own credentials that could be unique to the conversation:

-Got interested in computer games at the age of 10 (1994, timeline does matter here, WC2 and SC influences, kek)
-A+ and Network+ certified by 17 (wat? now)
-Went into the UMass Amherst program in '03
-Double-majored in Computer Science and Mathematics in '07 (yes doubled in 4 years)
-9 years later, developing full-stack applications and APIs for a multi-billion dollar non-profit

I am somewhat of a lurker on this subreddit though I actively check it daily for hints and news, and actively follow Scott Hanselman's blog. Enterprise work is in an alternate universe than freelance/open-source, and even still separate from the licensed X programming community. If you want a glimpse into Microsoft shops, please fire away. IMHO: It's developers helping developers
I'd be happy to help if she would like.
If it's not too late, I'd be more than willing to share what I know - keep me posted!
Senior engineer for Doctor on demand, not as cool as google maybe, but id love to help. I volunteer very often teaching young people code and love to help. Lmk! 
I would have no problem answering some questions. I stopped attending college after an associates and decided I was better off learning on my own. I self taught myself and now lead a successful career developing. I currently do most of my work for the Science tech/pharmaceutical companies. Some are publicly traded including Gilead Sciences. It's never too late/early to start learning.
Oh wow, I totally misread this the other day.

I'm interested if you don't have enough volunteers!

I'm a front end Web developer, with some back end experience. I'm currently developing on Shopify and another ecommerce platform. Prior to this I spent three years creating custom solutions for clients based on the WordPress platform. I've also touched on Magento, vBulletin and Code Igniter in my development career. For a while I was also developing web apps that were encapsulated in a native wrapper for smart phones (Cordova).

Essentially, I've seen the progression and evolution of several design Trends and browser deprecations. I find it a fun ride to learn new trends while improving my own abilities. I've had the frequent occasion where a design is just missing functionality. Sometimes an artistic concept just doesn't *work*.

I spent 3 years learning graphic design in College, only to find out I hate designing. Some of my education covered development, I loved it and excelled in it. Once I graduated I continued my web-ducation on my own time. 

After spending 2 years doing what was basically graphical data-entry and color resampling, I landed my first web development gig. That agency taught my many tools, the most important being debugging. If you can learn how to problem solve, you can work your way backwards from any issue.

Gimme a shout if there's anything else I can provide!
I'm actually a teenager too, just turned 18. I'm not specifically good at design, but I'm not bad either. 

I've been coding since 4th grade and teach robotics camps to elementary schoolers and am Team Captain of two robotics teams. 

Not sure how much she can learn from me, but I'm happy to answer questions. 

My resume is actually in my submission history if you want a look. 
I'm also a girl and started coding at 8, so I'd be interested. (I'm a front end dev after career change.)
I was going to volunteer, but this guy has his shit together. 

You stole me thunder. Thanks a lot for nothing. I thought this was my time to shine, but not today.

For what it's worth, I know Java 1.4.
I don't mean to be rude (since I'm asking about age), but at what age did these things happen? Just personal curiosity since I'm in the middle of changing careers also and wanna see how it could be if I wanna be super optimistic haha.
> I programmed my first application when I was 13 in TI-basic on my TI-83 during class. 

Some things never change.
Do you have a profile website or anything I can see some of your work? 
Fellow Orlandoian?
Can I interview you after? Would love to hear about your experience as a developer haha
How do you have time for all that?  
If someone has an eye for design, and has previously worked with Google, would you say that they have.... Googly eyes?
Gotta love cordova! Makes life so much easier! 
How you liking bluemix, compared to other platforms such as Heroku? 
I'd like to see this guy pass his 12 year old sister off to u/waffles_and_boobies
don't think so low of yourself. employees of google (associates, etc) are people just like you and me. they're not that much more special than any of us. we're more than adequate. (this is what i tell myself to keep me from having a nervous breakdown when times get tough. we'll be alright. people who work for big names may have better guidance but they're the same as us...)

Is that the one that's like uber for GPs and is based in London or nearby?

Someone who turned up at my coworking space recently did some freelance work for you guys I think.
You and me buddy, you and me.
Hah - hardly. I see way more talented people doing way more talented things. But that's all a part of it. The more you feel like you've learned, the more you realize you don't know.

However, a majority of my luck is due to living in a smaller city, where we are thirsty for developers.
The dude completed law school and did a comp science degree. Got to be late twenties?
I finished my undergrad in 4 years so I guess I was about 22 when I went to get my second degree. I finished that in 1.5 years, so I started working webdev around 24. I am 30 now. 
I spelled boobs
I don't have a portfolio site anymore since I don't really need it plus I've been spending time in other projects. I've been wanting to make a new one, just need to find the time. I typically don't think a portfolio site is so important to me anymore since I am primarily a developer and not a designer. I have a bunch of private repos and I have a list of files I send to employers for code examples. It's been awhile since I have updated those since I inly typically do that right before I start looking for a new job because my code style changes so much every few months as I learn new things. 

Edit: it's also do to no disclosures and code ownership. 
Yea, sure. Shoot me a pm. 
No kids yet...other than that I don't really have free time anymore. About to take a bunch of vacation this year and slow down. 
Absolutely.
So much easier! And it's gotten considerably better in the past couple of years. Even this last year if you use it with Crosswalk. So good.
It's alright. It's still fairly new and IBM were constantly updating it, especially the main service I was using (it was still in beta so IBM were updating it as I was using it), so it changed a lot over the period I was using it.

And then the whole thing went down a couple of times right before we were showcasing our game at a couple of competitions. So there were many frantic emails between me and the IBM devs. That was fun. :)

But overall it was pretty nice to use!


my name isn't much better :P I commend waffles_and_boobies for helping out. You can say whatever you want about his name, but he's a nice guy. 
Yeah, that's the spirit. I mean google employees are also made out of atoms and molecules. Just like us. They will also die one day and then when we have all died our UI/UX/coding skills will be exactly equal. So there. Something to look forward to! :)
There's a few. We're based on SF and American, but pretty sure there is European or British competition. 
What city? MY PASSION KNOWS NO ENDS
Damn, where I'm from I can't even reach much higher and don't even get anywhere close to decent compensation... But hopefully I can start my own company soon enough.

Just isn't a lot of great opportunity here
I didn't go to law school. I was just planning on it. Even got accepted. 
I am so jealous! I've been working my whole life towards being a better dev professionaly and a better intellectual person with academic backgrounds but man you went the full mile! Congratz :)
Some other things also never change.
What kind of code examples do you use? I'm attempting to get a job / internship at the job my best friend works at, and I can't for the life of me figure out what to show. They're really looking for someone that knows their Javascript, which I know quite well, but the only thing I could thing of are jQuery snippets, but there's not much with jQuery that I can see being super impressive.. 
Well, in my opinion it's great because you only have to build the app for a single platform. You can also separate work easier between a real designer and a real developer. The only sucky part is the fact you have to code in javascript. 
Shoot me a pm and I'll let you know. Cheap real estate and not enough developers, but that is changing quickly since the city started a free coding school. It's really popular. 
I think for the last interview I used a generator I made that was basically a front end stack our developers at our last job used so they didn't have to work in the cms editor. We were coding in our own editors, copy and pasted into the cms and tested. The generator used yeoman, bower, and grunt which allowed our devs to use the templating engine macros in our cms directly into our local machine. It also did the basics like compressing images, building CSS from all our sass files, minimizing js libraries, live reloading, etc. So all we had to do was build our site in the pre structured site architecture and copy and paste when done. Site would them work perfectly as if you were texting in the system. 

I also provided them with a couple of site frameworks I made from scratch and a Gantt Chart generator our sales people used to show clients timelines. Was built with JavaScript/jquery. 
Well, there's also Xamarin which does pretty much the same thing but you code in C# instead.

But I like Cordova because it's HTML / CSS / Javascript. Means I can do it all myself! :)
Yep, compared a couple of them. I prefer to stay on the architecture and backend development side of things though.
I find I spend way too much time trying to solve what should be easily googlable problems... 
I can never remember how to reverse a string in place without `.reverse`.

I'm a Tech Lead.
Happens to me all the time.

As far as I'm concerned, a major part of my job is being able to estimate how long it's going to take to do something.  And I prefer tools and frameworks where my estimates are lower (of course) and more likely to be correct.  That is, frameworks and tools where there are fewer nasty surprises.

And that's why I tend to keep a few years back from the cutting edge.
Yeah, so often I'm trying to find a fix for something, but all of the answers to the problem I find on google just don't cover my case or are addressing a different point. Then after hours of searching I come across the fix finally, and it was just one or two lines of code that needed to be changed to get everything working.
I often find if I expect something to take 20-30 minutes to track down and I make it half way through my time period and feel no closer to resolving it I will abandon it for the time being.  I find that simply walking away from a problem (assuming its not mission critical) will lead to one of two results:

1) I will come up with a solution while working through something completely unrelated.

2) Attempting to find results later will yield better results and you'll quickly find the answer you seek.  Sidenote to this one; knowing keywords to search for when seeking a solution is 99.9% of the skill.  Sometimes the right words don't come together immediately which is why I like to step away.
I was. Mostly because I wanted to optimize my solution further i.e. I already have the solution but wanted to search for the best solution.
I google how to do things when I don't know how to do it. Obviously you didn't know how to get an Analytics widget to work so you needed to google it in order to learn it. 
If you knew how to do it from the beginning obviously you would not spend half the day trying to make it work.

TL;DR: Don't blame google, sometimes solutions are more complicated than we expected.
Blame the internet.  No one wrote a blog post on "a simple Analytics widget to work on a site."
Yep just happened to me...  Spent a few hours trying to add server side custom validation to DevExpress MVC extensions, still can't work out it.  Have had to resort to asking DevExpress support.
Yes :(
This is why I always plan lots of time for unknown complications when depending on external stuff. We note this in the sprint meetings, like 1 hour actual work + 4 hours fighting. Then if it turns out to be done in 3 hours (sometimes it happens) you gained 2 hours!
Yes. I'm constantly googling function names and the order of parameters.

Can you guess what my primary language is?

But yeah, the most frustrating part of any day is when I think "Oh, here's a simple little task, will take me 15 mins". Then I find *one tiny little* snag in this otherwise simple job and that little snag takes me 5 hours to track down online.

This is one of the "unknown unknowns" I try and take into account when estimating a price for a job.
I've found that my problem is there's too much info on google and it gets confusing.  I used to be able to search for "facebook api" and get the answer. But now there are a multiple versions of the api so now I have have to figure out the correct search so now its "facebook api php version 3.1" and only show results from the past year.  Otherwise I spend time trying to make something work that was depricated 2 versions ago. 
this happens to me all the time. when doing estimates i usually figure out how long a project will take if everything goes the way i think it probably might go maybe if it all works out. then i single out the things i think i know how to do but i'm not 100% sure and add a half day for troubleshooting. it usually ends up being pretty close and then i don't get all stressed while trying to fix an annoying problem because i've allotted time for that. 

it was a holdover from my time in college where i'd have to make paper mockups of magazines. automatically add 6 hours to the time it should take for fussing with the school's printer. 
This is why I use Bing. No one can accuse me of just googling the code I check in.
No, because I am not an impostor. 


/s
On a similar note, what is with all the angst in r/webdev?
I have been weary of using google lately, its great but i tend to try to google to find out how things actually function as opposed to directly for solutions as i think theres a danger of becoming a bit reliant/not exploring all paths
Google is awesome and not just for the programming part. Don't know how to do something in Photoshop? Google! 

Don't know something about big data? Google!

Don't know where to eat? Google it!

Don't know what you don't know? Google it!

TL;DR Google it!
This happens to me a lot! I spend an hour on a bugfix, then think there must be a better way to do this, find a really elegant solution in stackoverflow and hate myself for not googling first.
Haha, fellow tech lead here and I also can never remember how to solve most of the generic interview exercises. 

In fairness, it's something I can do if I'm forced to think about it. But googling saves me thinking about it, so I usually opt for googling the answers to problems I know have already been solved a thousand times.


Occasionally I come across problems that aren't so often solved, or, if they have been solved, they're solved by companies that make a lot of money selling the solution; so the algorithms and designs aren't publicly available. I've often resorted to academic papers and journals in cases like that so I can gather enough knowledge about problems *like* my problem so I can come up with something that's good for my problem. Much more time consuming and sometimes not very fun either when deadlines are looming.
Just the individual letters? Isn't that easy af? Or whole words in a string?
Yeah, 7 years in a few languages and things slip by me quite often as well.  Doesn't bother me though.

We know what the OP must do now
Let us know how that goes. I find their support incredibly frustrating
It's unfun to google though. I mean it's a lot more satisfactory to create and invent things yourself and see those things working. Copy-pasting, applying someone else's widget or using someone else's library feels like meh. But yeah, it's kind of sad that with google you will probably get a better solution faster.
Thanks for saying that. Sometimes I feel dumb with the things I Google. 
Probably, yes. But he isn't necessarily talking about difficulty of it, just that it's sort of a novel task that is *hard to remember*. Honestly, I don't remember either. "Probably something with arrays" is my starting point, hahaha. A recursive implementation seems possible also. I also don't remember how the "in place" implementation differs from a sloppier version. Bleh. It's all doable, I just don't readily remember tasks like this. *insert that cute ASCII shrugging emoji here*
I will now live by that quote 
Google !== copy and paste. Sometimes all you need is a push towards the right direction.
Before Google we would have to search at programming books covered in dust and "possibly" copy their solutions. Google is the same but really really fast and vast. So, I wouldn't say it's sad at all...
You must be new. 
> I also don't remember how the "in place" implementation differs

Doing it in-place means that you modify the existing thing instead of creating a new one and without creating a temporary copy. So, to be able to reverse a string in-place, you'd need mutable strings.

If we pretend that the "letters" array is a mutable string, it kinda looks like this:

    let letters = [...'foobar'];
    for(let i = 0; i < letters.length / 2; i++) {
      let temp = letters[i];
      letters[i] = letters[letters.length - i - 1]
      letters[letters.length - i - 1] = temp;
    }
I don't know what sort of technical team you can lead if you can't figure out what "in place" means when referring to a bound-size data structure. 

Actually, I think if you pick a random person, explain them the basics of programming real quick, including what a string is, and they can't tell you how they'd go about reversing one, chances are they got some kind of brain damage.

Yeah that would be even more unfun. The whole idea of having to search for things is unfun in my opinion.
Woah, I'm not the same person who posted the original comment. I'm not the tech lead, /u/kalleth is. Even still, relax. 

Also, I never said I don't know what "in place" means, I said I don't readily remember **how the in place implementation DIFFERS from a sloppier (read: NOT in-place) implementation.** If you can instantly recall the specific programmatic differences between the two, more power to you. 

And regarding your second sentence: I don't know what you're on about, we're just saying that the specific implementations of a string reversal algorithm are kind of hard to rapidly recall. I'd have to sit and think for a minute. And regardless, this was all said in good humor, no need to randomly get passive aggressive. 

I also personally think you're drastically overestimating the average person's ability to think algorithmically, but maybe that's just me, hahaha.
Here's my feedback, nothing is aimed at offending you, just want to give you the means for better tutorials in the future  :

- Real life examples are very, very good. Have one per chapter and you're golden. They provide insight and help with what I feel is the hardest part in modern era development - linking theoretical knowledge to practical usage.

- The lesson is well thought out, but it's too long. Either speed up the montage in a video-editing software (1.25x) or cut stuff/speed up animations  and explaining. Explaining how Jade works if it's not part of your stack is useless - you're going to be presenting your viewers with how *you* do stuff so just mention that Jade is a template engine that you do not use, if you want to find out more about Jade visit this link.
- Get a different color scheme for sublime? The one you're using is not intuitive & not visually appealing.

- Time stamps in the description. ( I.e. 0:50 - What is Express? 2:33 - Installing Dependencies etc. )

- Voice is just fine, I sat through the entire thing . You're not Morgan Freeman, but you speak good english, the voice is neither too low or too high. Again, consider talking faster though.

- Instead of cramming everything up in a video consider creating a playlist. Thus, viewers get a sense of accomplishment once they finish a chapter/lesson/etc.

- Don't be afraid to be using visual indicators such as the rectangular highlight in this video. This is aimed at beginners, and due to how code is written, keeping up with which line(s) of code you're talking about could be facilitated.

Just my $0.02
Watch it in 1.5x speed, just way too slow otherwise.
Running through it now. You should populate the description with timing for each section, etc. Thanks for the upload.
I'll definitely run through this over the weekend. Thanks!
[deleted]
The lisp was too hard for me to sit through.  Sorry man....it looked well organized.
Thanks for your input, I think some of these points have been naturally addressed as can be seen in my newer vids.

And here is the [express playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGquJ_T_JBMTpKQptCmBDM9HcYrptCV0Z) for anyone interested.

I thought I was the only person doing this for tutorials.
I posted a link to the playlist for individual vids in the description.

Thanks for the suggestion.
I'm a little confused. When I do something in express, I've been using the standard boilerplate that looks like: 

    var express = require('express');
    var hbs = require('express-handlebars');
   
    var app = express();

    app.engine('handlebars', hbs({defaultLayout: 'main'}));
    app.set('view engine', 'handlebars');
    app.use("/styles" ,express.static(__dirname + "/styles"));
    app.use("/scripts", express.static(__dirname + "/scripts"));


    app.get('/', function (req, res) {
       res.render('home');
    });

    var server = app.listen(3000, function () {
       var host = server.address().address;
       var port = server.address().port;

       console.log(host, port);
     });

My understanding is this should only handle my routing and I can call a process manager or another serverside script for application level concerns? Sorry if this is a bit of a noob question, I'm fairly new to express.  
Never heard that before, maybe there were too many sss's in this.
I got the idea from someone on Reddit, it really is essential sometimes.
The only part of the above code that seems odd is that your using express.static twice.

If the styles and scripts folders are both located in the public folder, you can just say (__dirname + "/public") and everything will be seen by express.

Other then that, there a bunch of different ways to write our code.  So its more matter of practice + understanding what your doing.  Then you create the style that best works for you.
George Watsky's "S for Lisp" poetry slam: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GvTLfV8fls


Yeah, sorry man, probably not a comment that added any value to you.  Maybe it was just the audio recording that sounded off, maybe you were just a really soft speaker...I listened for a bit.  

I listen to a lot of stuff on my drive in to work and sometimes all I have is the voice so I might be a little extra sensitive to it over other people.
I don't really know your experience level or skill set but if you have any talent with front-end development you should not be working customer service jobs to "get your foot in the door" to start-up companies nor should you be working minimum wage ($11/hour is minimum wage in NYC right? Doesn't $11 barely buy you a pack of cigarettes over there?).

Ditch the temp agency and flesh out an interactive portfolio. Go create a profile on Dice and Cybercoders. Pour a few hours into a nice resume and another few hours into a professional cover letter and hit the job boards. Entry-level front-end developers make *bank* here in California and they probably do over in NYC as well. 
What exactly makes them awesome? They seem pretty bogstandard to me, and I don't really see why they require jQuery at all. It should take less than 10 minutes to implement something similar on any webpage in a vanilla JS.
You can make it a bit more compact:
http://codepen.io/anon/pen/eJWzPp
I have no idea why this is 'awesome' either
In fact, i can use pure css without the need for jquery. Use the :target pseudo selector. Thats why i agree its not awesome
That's interesting actually, I'll have to look into that.
Wouldn't that be considered bad practise? Sure you might get browny points from doing some cool pure CSS, but should you really handle state with CSS?

EDIT: Also that method would require using a hash, which could be used for something a little better than having tabs.
What makes it bad practice? You use hover and link pseudo selectors to handle "state" why is using target for its purpose bad practice? Same can be said for using media queries which effectively handle state as well. 
I just thought that it was better to handle things like that with Javascript, especially when you're literally altering what is visible on the page. Usually when you're using hover it just alters the element that you're actually hovering over, otherwise it just gets kinda messy and hack-y? Or is it the total opposite?
It is a bad practise because of the scrolling issue. 
[See here for example](http://codepen.io/anon/pen/obWdNo), no hacky CSS. 
What scrolling issue?
Still uses a hash though, not only does it make you have to mash the back button if you want to go back a page, I always like to use hashes for other useful stuff. For example using it to load in blog posts.
https://css-tricks.com/on-target/
https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/12/reimagining-single-page-applications-progressive-enhancement/
https://css-tricks.com/functional-css-tabs-revisited/
If you have an element that happens to have the same ID it may scroll down to that element instead of changing the tab? maybe that's what ze means?
Go back a page what? I can switch tabs without the need for the back button mashing. What happens with your example if JS is turned off? where is your graceful fallback? 
ID usage is singular, so it shouldnt be used on another element its not intended for. If an id is used on a div element for some purpose, it should only be used for that specific div, so this would not cause some scrolling issue if best practice is used.
If I open the pen, then play around with the tabs, then if I try pressing back space to get back a page it switches the tabs instead of going back a page, which is really annoying and bad user experience. JS turned off? who? why? Serious question btw.
[Want something more robust](http://codepen.io/anon/pen/WrjJXv)? Try this using radio buttons. still no hacky css and can use back button to return to a previous page.
That is a cool method and I've used it before. I like the idea of everything being self contained however, no need for extra elements, you just click the tab you want and let the script to the shifting around. As far as fallback goes, just make all the content sections visible on load then change it with script, so if there is no JS then all the sections are visible.
Thanks, this helps a lot!
I consider myself more of a front-end developer, but my current team uses C# and ASP.Net. I'd never used C# before I started there, but I'm able to lend a hand with modernizing their front-end, as well as help out where I can on the server side. You could probably do the opposite; use C# and back-end experience as your in, and express interest in gaining front-end experience (bonus points if you're on a cross-functional team that owns a whole application from front to back).

Edit: To answer your question, I wouldn't seek out a junior software engineer position if you have a few years of experience. You'll probably want a bigger company to start, where the work environment isn't too fast-paced for you to learn effectively.
It certainly can't hurt to have example websites (by providing the URL) ready to provide when asked before or during an interview that demonstrate your areas of knowledge/expertise pertaining to front end web dev.  

For example, go build a website that uses bootstrap front end but also has a good reason to use a C# backend, even if only for a contact form to leverage the C# .net email sending features. This way you can demonstrate both your C# knowledge and your passion for front end dev.

You absolutely want to make sure where you work cares more about giving you the ability to learn and less about you being a rockstar before you start there. That doesn't mean you should accept a shitty salary though ;) 
I'm just curious why? 
Don't take a step backward. Build a simple, but interactive website and start applying for jobs. Maybe even get your current employer to send you to training.
Nice, it's good to be able to talk about a production website even if you cant show it. 

Those are the tools I meant by interactive. You have a nice overview so I'd suggest picking a stack and focusing. The classic beginner first projects are a blog or a bug tracker. Really, though, some random thing that you would personally use is best.

Maybe apply with some larger companies first. They have larger training budgets anyway.
I'd say mid tier if you have extra capabilities and experience beyond C#. Schooled, sane general programmers with communication skill are always scarce. Explain your situation, show how quick you apply your higher skills to a new language. 

Might even work in your favour, so much kids who can write JS but cant maintain a complex project. Modern SPA's are now miles beyond jquery hackery and moved into real software development so you could bring something extra (if you have it).
> You'll probably want a bigger company to start, where the work environment isn't too fast-paced for you to learn effectively.

That's a great way of thinking. thanks.
Can you give an example of a sample website?
Great question. It's complicated (like all things).  
Don't get me wrong I LOVE c#. it's great! I love VS too.   
But C# isn't being used by 99.99% of the startups. That leaves me with joining an enterprise. It's just boring and limiting.     
Why doing front and not back? because I think I lack the ability to be a rockstar in back, and I might have a chance in front.
Also, I'm much more of a "product developer" so being in the front, puts you in a closer position to the users.


I also want to be able to build products that influences others. Doing 
We actually had a web app project which I built the front for, but I can't showcase it (it's company's property + it's ugly as my boss didn't want to invest in a designer/ui/ux for POC), and I'm not even sure how to call it's size - wheather it's a big project or not. Comparing to our main c# desktop application which is huge - the webapp is a tiny tiny app. So, i'm not sure.    
I'm leaving my current employee anyway :)

Another issue, is that c# experience doesn't translate for potential employers  s as js experience. 

Can you offer examples for "interactive website"?
I know JS, angular, html5 and the basic concept of css and sass (took 2 courses from codeschool on that). I also know the main tooling - gulp bower npm broweserify (learning webapack as we speak) and testing stuff like jasmine,protractor, karma. I'm currently teaching myself react thru it's official docs and Udemy course and I hope to build something with that once i'm done.    
  
Any ideas for a website would be highly appreciated. 

Thanks. Problem is with larger companies is the type of interviews. Most of them do whiteboard cs fundamentals/ algorithms/complexity problems. I really suck at those stuff. I have CS degree, so I know it, but don't use it often, don't remember it and when I really need something I read on Wikipedia and remembers. So, it's harder for me to get into larger companies. 
I was going to ask why too. In my experience front end devs get paid less. At least in my area C# devs are some of the highest paid.


If I were you I would diversify your server side skills somehow. You say you lack the ability. But front end dev can be just as difficult as server side. Its a myth that front end devs are less skilled. Thats just what employers want to believe so they can justify paying them less. It may be more efficient to pick up another similar server side language or another related technology. Maybe look into big data tech like Hadoop. Start ups love that stuff.


Or if you are insistent on going front end you can sell yourself as a full stack dev. Some small businesses like that because its like getting two employees in 1. (I know that doesn't make sense but business owners are stupid when it comes to anything that can save them money)


Alternatively you can try your hand at mobile apps. It has more of a programming feel while still getting that UX design experience.

I'm pretty sure everyone brushes up on those just for interviews. I know I do. Anything specific that you've been asked that you'd forgotten since school?
> front end dev can be just as difficult as server side  

believe me I know. It's WAYYY harder then just using c#. The amount of tools, the rapid pace, the undocumented stuff, the millions of way for doing things, etc... I know.  
  
> experience front end devs get paid less  

I don't do it for the money. well, at least not ONLY for the money/
  
> its like getting two employees  

Agree on that. In today's world I really don't believe a real full stack exist - at least not very good one (in both sides). Though it's a good idea using that c# background as back. The only prob with that is that I don't have web experience with c#, only desktop apps, so although I can write code - it doesn't tackle most of web problems (or at least that's what my unfamiliar mind thinks).  

Don't want to start learning mobile from scratch. I also think it will be gone in a few years and JS will rule the world lol.   
  
did I mention I have CS degree if it changes something?  

edit: formatting
> I was going to ask why too. In my experience front end devs get paid less. At least in my area C# devs are some of the highest paid.

This; and if you learn front end you should just go Fullstack since you already have the c# back-end background. Next step would be to study up on your design patterns and architecture. This could give you that verticle movement you are looking for because full stack devs are harder to find; or you are on the career path to development manager.
> believe me I know. It's WAYYY harder then just using c#. The amount of tools, the rapid pace, the undocumented stuff, the millions of way for doing things, etc... I know.

I find the key here is being pragmatic with your tool choices. Nothing worse that starting an application in a front end tool only to have breaking version changes once it finally matures; that's right Angular I am calling you out even though you are better now for it.
Can you get them to send you a screenshot? I don't usually go on wild goose hunts until I get a screen shot from them
Silly as it may seem, are you sure they client just doesn't think position of the Â£ is weird even though its rendering correctly? You know how clients can be sometimes :P

Other than that I would think the only thing that would affect it is browser differences for some reason. I tried Safari, Chrome, and FF on an iPad and it all came up fine. Doesn't seem like you're using anything weird that would be handled oddly by any particular browser though.
He has sent me one, but I am just going to forget it as it seems to be only Lenovo browser that is causing the issue. I haven't even heard of it, let alone know anyone who uses it. 
No, they sent a screen shot from the Lenovo browser which did look all awkward but they then installed Chrome and it worked fine. I think he's just being a bit tetchy. 
Yeah, its reasonable to only support the latest versions of the major browsers. Remind the client that you're not building a website for him to see, you're building it for HIS customers. 99.9% of them will be using a major browser.
For development environment I would use Vagran and I would not use a remote dev db. You should learn about database migrations and seeding. 
You would set up a git repository and you'd both clone that to your local machines. It'd might be a good idea to use a remote database indeed, so you're both in sync with that. 

Then it's regular git workflow as usual - you push changes and if someone else does, you pull them when you get the chance. If there are conflicts, resolve them. This wouldn't affect your live server, you'd have to manually deploy that when you feel like the repo is at a stable, releasable point. To do that you would probably drag the files from your local version of the site into filezilla. 
A repository I've used recently with a couple of other devs is Beanstalk - http://beanstalkapp.com/ - this requires me to push my changes to the repo which are then transferred to the live site.

Only downside I can see is that you have to ensure that changes work 100% before committing (generally good practice anyway tho, especially if implementing tests) - or I suppose you can use branches to test code first and then merge to retain a working master branch.
What I do: I set up a git repo on bitbucket.  I clone it on my local machine and on the server.  I make some changes to my project; git commit, git push.  I log into the server, git pull, and I run the setup script to build the site.  That's really about it.

With that, you can use any git workflow you want.  If you want to use branching and pull requests, you can do that (and you may want to, since you're working on this with others).
http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/

Create a new fix/feature branch and check it out locally, `git fetch && git checkout feat-foo`.

`gulp watch` to startup local dev environment, watch files for changes, run unit tests etc.

`git commit -a` with a structured message which can be picked up by a changelog parser. 

i.e.

    feat(foo): Added bar to foo

    closes #1

`git push`, create pull request to `develop` branch, CI system runs unit tests before allowing merge, create pull request to `master` branch, when tests complete *staging* server CI build gets triggered. Then once approved, tag a new version and have *production* CI build trigger.

You could use NppFTP plugin in Notepad++ to get/put files on server.

If you want more control, you could run your own git server.
Great! I'm going to check this out! Thanks!
Just want to add. If you have shell access to the server then install git and git pull and changes you want to deploy onto the production server. 

I run a site where the site's home directory is linked to the github repo. 
Cool! I will check this out as a viable option. Thank you very much. 
Great info. Thank you!
Wow this is really great information. I learned so much with just this post. Thank you. 
Another option is to use something like Travis or codeship to run a job on github checkin and just ftp the changes over.

https://codeship.com/documentation/continuous-deployment/deployment-with-ftp-sftp-scp/
I just did something similar to that with Travis CI and rsync over SSH on Digital Ocean. Works great!
Awesome. This is super helpful information. I am surprised at the comments I've gotten on here that isn't making me feel dumb... Thank you. 
Have you checked out any bundle solutions? I have one (https://www.specialesoftware.com) to suggest you. It will help you to build online business with multiple departments, but you will need the single platform for this. CMS is easy and understandable. 

You can follow step by step instructions or address your inquiries to online support team. Content management is WYSIWIG-friendly and if you have large volumes of data, like pictures and texts, it will be comfortable for you to process it all. 

Additionally, you will get access to numerous business development tools such as SEO, marketing, analytics, trigger generators and the others.
Internships in my area are usually 10-20hrs/week from $10-$15 an hour. Sounds like what you are looking for (although I don't know what your wages would be over there in CA)

 You have colleges in your area, so I would look at which one has a larger/better Web Development or Web Design program and reach out to the people in charge  (Dean of the CS or CIT department) and tell them you would like to have an intern. Those people in charge know the best of the best students that are looking for work. There is also the possibility that internships count for 1-3 credits at the college (they do at mine!) which students like myself would looove. It requires some paperwork on your end, and the college might even pay for the intern.

So lay out exactly what you are looking for (someone that knows WordPress, front end stuff, and whatever else you require), the college can help find that person, and it may just help you find someone for a temporary internship (or permanent junior dev if it works out well enough!)

Source: am college student going in to an interview tomorrow, to get an internship that I hope turns into a full time job opportunity :)  wish me luck!
I accepted $16/hr in uni, but I wasn't too happy about that rate.
When I did my internship I made $10 doing more than this. It was a wordpress shop and I was basically doing the same work as the full-time devs just not the same workload. I'm still kinda mad I didn't get any sort of raise and I worked there for two years. Anyways $10-$15 seems reasonable depending on location.
You don't need to hire another developer, you need to raise your rates.

Then maybe hire another developer.
Hiya, I've  recently started teaching myself javascript, html, css, just touched on sql, php and one very poorly understand bit of mainly copy and pasted ajax. Alas I live and work full time in sunny Scotland.
However if you think there's anything I could help you with at my level on an adhoc basis I'd happily do the odd bit for in exchange for some the odd bit of help with my own learning. 
Although you wouldn't get the WYSIWYG content updating, perhaps a static-site generator such as Jekyll could be useful
WordPress is probably a good place to start. There are even simpler options out there too, like this for example: http://dropplets.com/

Doesn't even use a database. There are probably similar alternatives as well.
I really love using kirby CMS, its a simple flat file cms that can be really easy to use for templating etc.. Might be good for you, go check it out.
This looks cool but it seems like it's primarily for blogs? The site I'm building just needs to have a blog built into, it isn't the main functionality. Also doesn't seem like something very user-friendly to update.
If you're using jQuery you can use the toggleClass function. 
An alternative to using a boolean variable to keep track of its open status could be to use a special class name instead.

For example, when you click on the button and the menu is shown:

    var menu = document.getElementById('menu');
    menu.className = "open" 
    //or, if you already have a class specified do, `= menu.className + " open"`

Removing the class sort of depends on if the menu element only has this one class or not. If this is the only class it has, you could do:

    menu.className = "";

Note, this removes ALL classes from that element. If you have multiple classes on that element, to remove only the `open` one, do something like:

    menu.className = menu.className.replace(/open/g, '');

If you want to check if the element has that class:

    menu.className.match(/open/);

An extra note: If you only care about this working with modern browsers that support HTML5, then there's javascript that makes the above a little easier:

    menu.className.classList.add("open");
    menu.className.classList.remove("open");
    menu.className.classList.contains("open");

Super simply example here: https://jsfiddle.net/t93nzf6o/
There are lots of ways to do it. e.g. Define a global variable

    var isOpen = false;

Then set your onClick action to include

    if(isOpen){ //do stuff to remove expanded class from menu}
    else{//do stuff to add expanded class to menu }
    isOpen = !isOpen;

Or add a data property to the menu tag

    <ul id="menu" data-expanded=false>

and check the state of the data property with

    var expanded = document.getElementById("menu").getAttribute("data-expanded");
    //open or close menu then set the attribute to true/false as appropriate

Or add a class to the element when it's open and test for the presence of that class to see if you should run your open or close function.

To be honest, though, I think that your problem is probably a syntax error or a variable scoping error as the methods you used should at least give you some result, even if it's not the best way to do it. If you're seeing nothing at all, you've probably got an error in your code. Have you checked the browser console for Javascript errors?


Uh, just use a boolean to keep track?
All I can suggest is that you learn the fundamentals of programming before you become a 'web developer'.
So make a variable something like is isOpen and set it to true when the open function runs and false when the close function runs?

I tried that and it also didn't work :(

Maybe my syntax was off?
I wish I could double downvote comments like this. You're fine, OP. Ask, learn, prosper, and ignore this ^
He's trying to learn by asking us.
"It didn't work" is not enough information to go on. We need to see the code. Obviously there was some error in it. Checking if the height of the menu is 0 px should also work in theory, but again, "it didn't work" is not enough information to go on.
There's also a demo video that highlights 2Sli.de features: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YXthp3vcJs
They're not loading as you click because they're all loaded to the DOM at once, and hidden/shown with javascript. You can use the [history api](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/history) to change the URL. 

Edit: here's a basic demo: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/bEWEeb

If you run this in a browser (outside of codepen), the URL will change. Only problem is if someone gets that linked to them, they will be sent to website.com/Home, etc, which doesn't exist. So you'd set up something to direct all traffic to the frontpage (via .htaccess for apache, for example). You'd also need to write some additional javascript logic to parse the url and activate the proper tab. 
very cool, thank you for your help!
There is a big difference when it comes to designing building a website from scratch without a wire diagram and color mockup of how the site should look and when you do work from a wire diagram and color mockup.

Try instead of coding, build a website using paper and pen. layout how the site should look and feel on each page while being consistent. Move on to a color design in photoshop or other editor.

Then start with putting together the semantic markup if the site, dont worry about css just yet. Go through it when you are finished to ensure that it follows best practices.

The best approach for me with css is to start with normalizing the page, set your font, font size, and background/ nav color. Then move on to positioning the content, dont worry about making it responsive as that can be done after you have a working layout.

with regards to js, dont bother with it until you have a feel for html/css. Get comfortable with html and css to a point where you dont feel daunted. 
I'm in the same boat as you!  At the end of the day what matters is that you can get whatever the job at hand is, done.  From scratch is never truly  "from scratch", so don't get hung up on it.  You can use frameworks and steal ideas from others.

How many hours do you typically try before you give up?  You won't ever be able to "throw together something QUICK".  Focus on getting 1% better each day and if you actually keep to it, you will be able to look back and be exponentially better than you are.  I'm willing to bet you try for a while and then give up and then you start the process over some weeks and months later--that's what I do, anyway.

Being in your 30s and being female means nothing.  You are in your prime to learn these skills and you can achieve them if you consistently work on the stepping stones.  Take a deep breath and remind yourself that practice makes perfect and repetition is what will teach you.
>  but they all used stuff, doesn't seen from scratch.

Looks like you already realize that there's no such thing as "from scratch" 

Most of the people who write job postings are developers. They don't speak code like you do. What they mean is "you need to be able to do more than install wordpress."

You're gonna be fine and I promise you're more competent than you think you are!
For JR roles "from scratch" could mean as little as HTML + a Css file with any number of css/js libraries/frameworks as you need to get the effect that you want.

Basically they mean "don't use a website builder or a CMS with a purchased theme, write it in code" nothing too over the top.

This may be a little too advanced for you but there's everything you need to learn in this little starter kit https://github.com/google/web-starter-kit. If you can understand almost everything going on in this, you'll be fine for a mid range role so maybe take a look at this, one feature at a time (ie. sass, gulp, browsersync, etc.)
Let me give you a piece of advice. 

Your age and gender obviously have nothing to do with why you're "untalented". The reason why you are struggling is simply because you haven't had enough practice.

It's relatively easy to reach a junior web dev position. Take me for example, i started learning from scratch in January 2015 and got my first junior web dev position by November 2015. I didn't know nothing when i started but i put in some serious work. Dedicated at least 4-6 hours a day to study and build things.  

Read books, watch videos, follow tutorials and most importantly apply your knowledge to try and build things. Doesn't matter if they suck ass or don't work, the process of making mistakes and finding solutions to those mistakes is what will help you learn the most.

Work hard and stay persistent with your studies.

Stand on the shoulders of giants like the rest of us.
Nothing great is built "from scratch" 

What have you built so far ?
I'm just about wrapping up my first online site (I've made loads for when I was in university but this will be the first that's online).

The hardest part I found was getting an idea of what the website would look like. Personally, I looked around at other developers portfolio sites and picked out layouts I liked and didn't like. The website I had in mind then started to take shape.

Then you just start coding, start with the absolute basics, the header, the body... and then just work your way from there.

I was also learning while building, reading responsive web design by Ethan Marcotte and applying the techniques to the website gave me a reason to keep building.

In the end I'm pretty happy with how the website is shaping up, It borrows layouts from other websites I've seen online but it looks good (IMO) and is responsive.

My point is just focus on the next part of your plan, right now that is design the layout of the website, the rest should flow naturally.
>Oh and my age is also an issue. I'm in my 30's and female, is that why i'm so untalented?

You're unmotivated and with all these tutorials online it's easy to get overwhelmed. I have a ton of sites I've built that look awful. I have been reading/watching videos on user experience and design. It's helped me a bunch.

I fire up Illustrator (because I know how to use it) and mock up a site. Then I get in Webstorm and make it with HTML and CSS. Then I play around with media queries to make it mobile/tablet friendly. I also take notes in a One note document on things that I figure out so next time I can have a quick reference guide.

I hope this helps.
If you have some money to spare (about $50) I'd recommend a month or two of TeamTreehouse. Pick a track there and stick with it till you finish it, that should give you some direction instead of going from place to place and book to book to make sense of it all.

Don't get discouraged you just have to take it all step by step one problem at a time.

Also building sites from scratch is all about perspective, don't worry too much about it. Learn to write HTML, CSS and Javascript without using external libraries and frameworks, after you're confident you understand and are proficient in using them start learning more about frameworks and libraries. 
I don't see a problem with either your age or your gender, it shouldn't be an issue if you're working in a Western country. Its also fairly common for people to change career and start again in their 30's and 40's.

First, you seem to think you should know everything. You don't need to. It's perfectly OK to specialize. If you want to code by hand, great be a front end dev, or back-end if you just want pure code. If you prefer the visual design side of things, and really have no talent for code, become a Web Designer. That's the people who do the mock-ups in Photoshop and Illustrator and then hand it off to be coded by a developer. 

So think about what it is you really want to do and do a bit of research into the job descriptions of each. Don't take the *quick* path, take the *right* path.

Hope that helped.
What worked for me is I bought a book on HTML & CSS and I locked myself in my room for a week and a half and went through every page and example in that book. I came out the other end pretty good at coding HTML & CSS sites "from scratch". Books are better than random tutorials because it can give you a cohesive knowledge base from start to finish.

Unlike other opinions on here I'm of the opinion that building a website from scratch is the foundation before you should learn anything else. "From scratch" means using a code-editor (Notepad++, Sublime Text, etc) to build a web page. Once you can do that you'll have a very solid foundation and only then introduce yourself to Javascript, or Bootstrap, or Wordpress. Those are all tools that can take your skills to the next level but are extremely difficult to understand what's going on under the hood if you're not intimately familiar with HTML & CSS.

Some book recommendations that I've personally used:
http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920036364.do
http://www.peachpit.com/store/html-and-css-visual-quickstart-guide-9780321928832

Either of the above books are good, the Visual Quickstart is more of a complete manual on HTML/CSS, and the Missing Manual touches on a little bit of HTML/CSS but also covers a lot of the peripheral skills, such how to best structure websites, how to aquire web hosting, a javascript primer, and whole bunch of other good stuff.

You can do it, start with the basics.

TL/DR: Learn HTML & CSS. Ignore everything else until you can build simple websites using only that.
There are basically two types of ways to create a website.

One is to install a package like wordpress or magento and customize it a little bit to get the site you want.

The other is to write your own code and create your website you want to do something that you can't do with an existing package.

Compare it with buy a van (as in car) and putting in the shelving you want for your job and buying a chassis and building up the entire vehicle as you want. 

Buying a house and decorating it the way you want vs building the house as you want.

The latter is more "difficult" but the first is what a hell of a lot of people do. 

But in web development, becoming say a wordpress guru doesn't mean you are even a junior from scratch developer. Vice Versa, I am a from scratch developer but have to look up the simplest things for wordpress. The disciplines are related but not the same.


As a from scratch developer, I use an IDE not a text editor and I do use frameworks and libraries. Now I do occasionally see vacancies require you to know raw javascript and not use things like Jquery or other frameworks. I would run like hell. It would be like building a house and first start by creating life to eventually evolve into trees you can then use for lumber. It is a bit to much "from scratch". 

> I have nothing

And this is the thing, one thing an employer wants is to see you can finish something. Even a simple thing. People sometimes show on here simple things like a javascript calculator and ask is that enough. It at least is something, the interviewer can see you took and idea and made it work. That you can finish a job.

So try to think of something simple and fun and just build it. Not the next facebook but a simple basic thing that is yours, you made this and you can talk about it and use it to sell yourself as a junior. 

I would say that "from scratch" using a text editor like notepad is unrealistic. 

A good analogy would be to ask an admin assistant if they can keep notes using a typewriter -- more than likely, the answer is yes, but most assistants would be more productive with a laptop, etc.

Can a good developer code from scratch, using just a text editor? Probably. But again, it's not really a good test case.

Now, onto your specific case: I don't think age or gender have anything to do with how talented you may be or how successful you may be as a developer. I think what it boils down to is: hard work, a willingness to learn, and being able to solve problems. Does that sound like you? If so, keep at it!

If I were in your shoes, I'd browse around for a bit, find a few portfolio sites I like, and try to replicate them. Maybe start with some easy things for your portfolio -- dribbles, sketches, jsfiddles, etc.

Hope this helps!
To get something up quick, open up terminal, run yeoman (or something similar), and you're basically almost done and there you can fill it in with whatever other projects you have complete. 

I would say yes, open up a text editor, type in your html, css, js if needed and build it out. It shouldn't be that hard and if you can't do it without a tutorial, then just keep trying as this is something a junior dev should be able to do. It doesn't need to look great or do anything complicated. 

I don't think there is anything wrong with using a framework for your portfolio site as shows you can use them. Especially for a junior position.

Also - I don't think your age is much of an issue and your gender DEFINITELY shouldn't be an issue with any place you would want to work at in the first place.

Edit: Once you get a handle on that if you're looking to work in a company with more than one person, get a handle on using git/vc. Might want to take a look at sass/less as well.
>Oh and my age is also an issue. I'm in my 30's and female, is that why i'm so untalented?


I'd say its very likely that your female gender and age of mid thirties are correlated with a lack of talent. This is probably why you haven't yet made a portfolio - you are physically incapable of doing it. 

All the best and good luck! 
Yes to this. We all use frameworks. But I wouldn't recommend them until you have the basics- html and css. Don't even worry about sites- just do pages to start. Don't bother with servers at first- just do files and open them direct in a browser. Once you're comfortable with that- pick a direction to expand into- js, servers, code.
Wireframing (drawing out boxes, columns etc., no colors) is a MUST because when you're in the weeds of a thousand nested divs you will get disoriented, confused and forget what you're supposed to be building. This is doubly true because every site designed today is responsive, so you aren't just looking at one 'grid' of boxes to fill with text and media, but something that will look OK on multiple devices.
A bunch of junk...
Web designers who don't know code are not web designers. They are graphic designers who make comps and ask someone to turn them into a website. You simply cannot design a ui if you don't have an understanding of how it works at some level.

Web designers need to know HTML and CSS at a minimum. Static psd comps are extremely out dated and a bad way to go about building a site.
Why have weeds of thousands of nested divs in the first place, I wonder.
Is it working junk?
This is true
For my first Web Developer job I started at a small company which had an intermediate-level front-end position even though I felt like I was only around junior-level. I made it clear with them that my skills still need a bit of work as I'm only familiar with HTML/CSS, understand concepts such as responsive design and know almost no JavaScript. However, I'd be willing to learn as per the requirements of the position.

It could have been due to a lack of great candidates but somehow I received the position. My first project was working on a Web Application using AngularJS. I thought to myself, "web app... what? I've never done that before, AND I don't even know JavaScript." My boss told me they need to add a couple of features to it in 1 week, it took me 2 and I had to ask A LOT of questions.

Next project was ASP.NET, never even touched that in my life. I was able to learn and complete the project on time, even under pressure.

During my time working there sometimes I felt like it was too difficult for me, like I didn't belong there, as if I was holding the company back at times. Just before leaving though my boss told me he was very happy with my performance and dedication towards the job. Looking back, I've learned so much from that position and I'm glad to have been able to experience that. My first Web Development job gave me confidence, the right mindset and attitude that I could bring with me to my other workplaces. It taught me to get out of my comfort zone, constantly learn new things and quit being lazy.
I started my first job almost 6 months ago and so far it has been pretty great.

|What kind of position was it?

Jr. Front End Developer

|What were your responsibilities?

This was pretty unclear to me when I started. I am the front end dev of a 4 man team in charge of a section of the site. Since a lot of the stuff we've implemented since I joined was way more back end heavy I was allowed to join other teams and work on some really cool stuff during the down time. The website I work for is going through a redesign at the moment, so I started building modules for the new style guide. I was chatting with the dev in charge and he told me they needed to build a global search app. I asked if I could help and he spoke with my supervisor and assigned the whole thing to me. I had never worked with a js framework so it was both exciting and scary. As a Jr dev I thought I would be doing little css jobs and quick template stuff.

|What was your skillset when you first started, and what did you learn on the job?

Oh man I've learned so much in only 6 months. Git and using it to code with a team effectively, continuos integration, some Java, some Python backend, backbone.js/marionette.js , ES6, gulp, npm, some postgres, a ton of linux commands (devs get a sandbox server that runs debian), and vim. I also improved everything else. My supervisor looks over my commits and tells me when he sees something I could do better. Pretty much everyone is always ready to help/discuss. When I have a question or want to discuss something I just hit up one of the senior guys on slack, and they come over to my desk pull up a chair and sit down with me to talk about the issue. 

The company is just really really helpful if you want to learn. They have knowledge exchanges every week, where devs present about different topics. They have a dev who's old job was building backbone search apps and they assigned it to me because it would be a great learning experience! He checked on me every so often and gave me some pointers on how I could do some things better making sure to explain why and taking my input into consideration. Even if I was offered another job with a way higher salary I wouldn't take it. This is pretty much getting paid to get real experience and great education.
>What kind of position was it?

IT

>What were your responsibilities?

Keep stuff running.

2006, I worked in IT at the time for a small community bank, we had a shitty iframe based intranet. 

I found out I enjoyed the idea of creating things online, by the time I left the company, the intranet was running Joomla! featuring company news/blog articles, employee directory with "gamified" badges awarded to those employees that participated in charity events (my idea), document directory for policies/procedures/etc, secure VP/board portal where higher ups saved/viewed meeting minuets and other documents (responsive to be viewed on their shiny iPads I had recently deployed), and probably some other things I'm forgetting. Was dope. 

>What was your skillset when you first started

Didn't know web development.

>what did you learn on the job?

Also off the job, but HTML/CSS/some JS/PHP. Web server management with LAMP stack.
My first job as a WebDev was at a small company which sold their own CMS and project management tools. Was written in plain PHP and MySQL functions. They needed someone to change the PHP MySQL stuff to a dbal which was very popular at the time called ADOdb, to support any other databases. That was in 2004. My skillset back them was pretty thin. The only thing I've written wirh PHP at that time was the obligatory Web 1.0 guestbook. It was then when I decided I wanted to write my master thesis about PHP 
Jr dev position

Was just going to make simple CMS websites.

I had a very limited skillset in terms of web dev, just a mediocre knowledge of html/css and basic programming.

I was given a site and time to do it, had a more senior dev to discuss things with, but most of the time I was just googling. For a while I thought I'd never figure it out. I was given room and time to learn. In future projects, as I grew more comfortable, I was able to experiment and expand. Now there's just less time for experimentation but I feel comfortable with 99% of what's done at the shop, am able to steer projects and proposals in the right direction, and ready to expand the shop's capabilities in a bigger way.

Are you having issues with personnel, projects too hard/too easy, or something else? Whatever your issues, maybe try and discuss them with your bosses.
Mine was a flower shop in 1998, that I got it through a friend who was a consultant and it was a client of his.  I wasn't even looking to get into being a web developer, and all I knew was some HTML.  Over the course of a month I learned as I went and built it.  They used it for several years.  After that, I picked up other projects and got more into it.
Well my first job (which I'm still at! It's a great company) was as a junior PHP dev. I started out doing small bug fixes, and I've moved into doing large projects and the like.

It would probably help a lot more if you were to tell us what sorts of things make you wonder if it's normal/right, and we can relate our experiences relating to those specific things.
>What kind of position was it? What were your responsibilities? What was your skillset when you first started, and what did you learn on the job?

Junior back-end developer* with front-end assistance when required.
Creation of bespoke systems/web apps, wordpress stuff, odd things like creating HTML emails...

(* are you still a junior if you're the only one?)

I'm still at the same place and I learn on the job every day. I've been mostly doing server admin stuff for the past couple of months too - hardly even touched any code. I've been there less than a year and I'm the only person there that knows what they're doing when it comes to looking after our servers.

Before I started, I knew pretty much zero about Linux and the Windows Server OS's, but know I'd say I'm a pretty good power user, which is great as I always wanted to learn (and can now mess around with my RasPi easier at home!).

I've also learned a lot about how the web works behind the scenes, gained more experience in programming in general, realized how shitty some people (ie hackers) can be and met some nice people.

----

>I am asking because I am having a very poor experience with my first "web developer" position and am wondering all kinds of "Is this normal?" "Is this right?" questions. 

I guess it depends on a lot of factors, but being any sort of developer (or any job in the tech industry for that matter)  requires *constant* on-the-job learning.

The absolute best way to learn with development is to "learn by doing". If something doesn't work, undo your last change and try again! If it doesn't look right, undo it and try again, and don't be afraid to ask for a second opinion from a colleague. There's also the internet if it's a technical related issue.

Basically, as a developer, if you're not Googling at least 18000 times/day, something is wrong.
My first real webdev job was on a platform hosting casual flash games built as a Facebook app supporting several languages and written in asp.net (before asp mvc).  
My responsibilities were maintaining the thing, adapt to Facebook changes, ensure working payments (games were free to play but included buyable items), integrate new games in the front with corresponding backend services, and add new features like optimized in-game inbox, achievement system or collectibles with exchange abilities.  
I started with knowledge in html, css, js, C#/ Asp.net, php, mysql and Sql server.  
I learned a ton of stuff on the whole stack: leveraging js prototypes, building webservices, using cache on several layers, using build systems, writing unit tests, using source control properly, managing a database, managing cross-cutting concerns (logging, monitoring, auth...)  
I've been very lucky with this first job as I was a self-taught developer and it gave me a big head start on real engineering at scale, on a site having millions of plays per day at its peak. I spent several years there before moving on and if I'd started elsewhere I don't know if I'd had become the lead dev I'm now in my current company.
Oh man...memory lane.

I got my first job writing web pages in 1995. I was an "online communication technician" for [IUPUI](https://www.iupui.edu/). My job was to put the IndyUNIX user's manual online. Tables had recently been introduced to HTML, and I harnessed their awesome power to replicate the multi-column format that the print version of the manual employed. Bleeding-edge technology, for sure.

If I recall correctly, I was provided with the manual in Word or similar format. I'm not sure what I was using as a text editor back then...actually, probably [BBEdit](http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/), which I still use now and then. I started on the first page and wrapped everything in HTML by hand. It took all summer.

One of the coolest aspects of the job is that I was putting a University's UNIX manual online, so I basically read the entire thing a couple of times over by the time I was done. Good knowledge to pick up as a 14 year old.

Web development was not overwhelming back then. In fact, it was a hell of a lot easier. There weren't many HTML tags. JavaScript and CSS didn't exist. You could literally learn all of HTML in a day. The project was very straightforward. Progress was easy to see and measure. Hell, I wish my job was anything like that today.
Those were dark days indeed...

I didn't know any better, and was hired as "Contract to Hire". Only there was no contract term and I was an employee in everything but name. Even had to sign a contract saying I couldn't do work for companies while I worked there. All of this so the owner didn't have to pay his side of employee taxes to the government which left it up to me to pay 33%. I was young dumb, and didn't know my rights.

On the business side the owner was just bad! He didn't know how to quote, and constantly got bad clients with cheap jobs not worth our time. The good clients we did have were in a constant good/bad relationship with the owner. The funniest one, looking back, was the morning the owner was supposed to deliver a script. The client called asking where it was he said he'd give to them maybe next day. He of course just couldn't understand as to WHY the client was upset with him for not having it done on time.

I was so glad when I got the call from my current company (going on 4 years with them). The only good thing that came from this was working under a guy who helped teach me basic PHP since all I had back then was html/css
    What kind of position was it? 

Wordpress Developer for agency

    What were your responsibilities? 


Build Wordpress sites for local businesses/newspapers/churches


     What was your skillset when you first started

Knew some HTML and a little CSS. Was more of a traditional developer, and knew some C# and Java though not professionally.


     and what did you learn on the job?

PHP and SQL bigtime. Design. Deeper CSS. Also dealing with clients and how to professionally reply to emails and deal with difficult people.


The pay was poor, I did it for only a year. The hours were 24/7, if I wasn't sleeping I was working. Had some difficulties with the owners of the agency not paying me- and from taking things like his own rent and car repair bills out of the company (and in one instance out of my % commission). I left bitter being owed about $3k. It helped me land a real job, so it was all worth it. Do the upstart/intern/junior thing but don't do it for more than a year if the pay is bad and they treat you poorly.
I'm from Mexico, and i just finished my Computer Engineering degree. But my first webdev that i've done, was in my university, in the Postgraduate and Research department, they needed a web developer who knew PHP, HTML, CSS, JS and Mysql for a small system in the browser to control all the scholarships from the university on this specific department.

My interview was only one question:
"How good are you making systems?"
To wich i reply:
"Very good"... obviously i had no idea how good was i, because i never made a system before haha.

So it began, started learning all the things that i needed to do the job. I already knew a little bit of Html, Css, Js, Mysql and Php... but it was REALLY just a little, i knew they existed and just some examples but in reallity i had no idea what i was doing.

But in reallity, i learned a lot from that job, i learned a lot of PHP and Mysql, Html and Css i learned much as well, and JS, i learned the basics because my app didn't rely on JS, instead on PHP.

Then it was my starting point to see that, even i didn't know much, i could still learn things on the run, so i can finish the project in time, so i started working as a free lancer. 

Shortly after, i had a project in a little hospital to store information about their clients and patients. Again this teach me a lot of things and that i can learn a lot of stuff in the run.

Now i just finished my degree, and i'm working for a company making web aps, even tho it's not my area specifically (Computer Engineering has a lot to do with hardware as well), i do enjoy my job so much.

The key is in even you don't know that much, you can rely a lot on documentation and tips from the Web. Read as much as you can, and remember that you're not the first web developer in the world, this means that what you want to do, somebody already did it, so it's just a matter to search in google and a little bit of patience you can find what you need.

Cheers dut!
Good thread, I am a newbie to doing WebDev professionally, and I feel very under qualified compared to my colleagues, so this thread has been helpful as it looks like a lot of you were at a similar level to me when you started 
Year 1996. I was 15 and my dad said "hey I sold a website to a client, now you make it"... I didn't know anything about html so I had to find some tutorial.. A couple of <table> and <p> (and animated GIFs obviously) later, I had the first version. Ugly as hell but it worked like magic. Simple times.. No css, no Javascript, no php, no nothing. 
I'll tell you.. after someone in this thread gives me a job
Dear /r/webdev forum, I never thought it would happen to me but...
Appreciate to story.
You've given me more confidence to continue my search for a job in web dev
Thank you, that was extremely inspiring. Amazing that they would hire someone with so little JS experience. I don't mean that in a condescending way, I just didn't know that was possible and it gives me hope. Often I feel like I don't know nearly enough to apply for many jobs.
Wow! Can you tell me more about the process of taking on those responsibilities? Did you just dabble on the side and mention stuff to your boss and they jumped on board and told you to go for it, or did you eventually leave your position for that of a web dev and then make these improvements? What was that transition like for you?

I imagine you must have been really valuable to them. I bet they were sorry to see you go.
>It was then when I decided I wanted to write my master thesis about PHP 

Haha. What are you up to these days? Thanks for sharing your story.
> 
> I had a very limited skillset in terms of web dev, just a mediocre knowledge of html/css and basic programming.
> I was given a site and time to do it, had a more senior dev to discuss things with, but most of the time I was just googling. For a while I thought I'd never figure it out. I was given room and time to learn. In future projects, as I grew more comfortable, I was able to experiment and expand. Now there's just less time for experimentation but I feel comfortable with 99% of what's done at the shop, am able to steer projects and proposals in the right direction, and ready to expand the shop's capabilities in a bigger way.

Were you doing procedural or OOP PHP? Were you using a framework?
Addendum: reading this it kind of sound like my first job was a dream job, so I must add that it's only in retrospect that I can see all the benefits for my technical evolution and my later career. But the main drawbacks at the time were that:  
 first, I had to put in a lot of (unpaid) hours, often staying late at night to release new games and features with last minute changes pushed by marketing or funders taking over game designer's vision.  
Second, the environment was very stressful (lot of conflicts between 'creative' people all wanting to put their mark on the product and giving incompatible requirements).  
Third, some things were highly unethical (so-called 'social gaming' was all the rage, so it was a very concurrential space, and the 'role model' was Zynga: monitor every player's action and target the population with an addictive playing behavior as they're spending the most).  
Lastly, after two years on that battlefield I was still paid 10% below the market rate for junior developers. Because hey, it's the gaming industry, so the privilege of working in gaming is worth being underpaid, right?  
So I ultimately left before losing my health and sanity.
>Wow! Can you tell me more about the process of taking on those responsibilities?

We didn't have a web team or person so since it had a power cable it fell into IT's domain. I had made smaller updates for awhile, basic link updates or updating some documents. That got me thinking about web development so I purchased one of those big yellow "learn HTML/CSS" books. 

I remember reading through that thing during a trip to see some family, I thought I was the shit. Building stuff with words and all. 

At the time, before learning about CMSs, I was out with friends, I think one of them was moving out or something and I casually started talking about making websites and one of the guys there that had some experience with it, mentioned content management systems, I of course was like whaaa? He said it to me like this, "how do you think Microsoft manages all their pages, they don't edit one page at a time."

Blew my mind. He mentioned Joomla! CMS, so that's what I jumped into first. 

I pitched the idea with my boss to let me do something different, I setup the server and went from there. 

During my last year or so there, I was also working on my first large personal site, using Joomla! of course. It was a social networking site for League of Legends. Using available extensions and plugins, I hacked together a site that, in it's hay day, had the largest collection of League fan art and fan made stories. Had many writers submitting stories regularly and was working on getting others to claim and submit additional art and writings. The social aspects was pretty much what you expected, very similar to Facebooks features at the time.

>I imagine you must have been really valuable to them. I bet they were sorry to see you go.

I sure hope so. The company went through some management changes and cost cutting, banking was hard at the time I guess, so I moved on. 
I am a full time web developer at a professional association (field is labour law). 
Holy crap, that LoL page sounds amazing. Wow. So, what are you doing these days? Still in web dev?
>Holy crap, that LoL page sounds amazing

Yea it was cool. But was way ahead of itself. Riot games (makers of LoL) just didn't have the bandwidth like they do now for community projects. Having access to the API they have now would of been awesome to integrate more with the game and user profiles.

From there, in between jobs I did some volunteer work for a non-profite, took them from a free blogger site to Joomla! and an actual domain, was cool to see that grow. 

New job, back in IT and my taste for CMS based sites began to decline as I wanted more control. On my free time and with a cause, I learn't Codeigniter and built an IT inventory system for the IT team. Great learning experience since I had a clear goal, move away from Excel spreadsheets.

I'm now a digital marketer, still building tools and sites on the side, using Laravel. 
How many visitors did the site get? Did it generate any revenue?
About 100K pageviews per month, I had some adwords running but I don't recall it generating much since ads were hidden for registered users.
This is one of the best tutorials I've found in any topic.

I pick up freelance webdev and SEO jobs easily.

Just need to build a name for yourself and have a nice website that has what services you can profile + your past work history in your portfolio.

Get the client on the phone, let them know you know your stuff.
What language and frameworks do you use?

Thanks
For clients with a low budget: WordPress or SquareSpace

For big budget clients: WP or if they dont need a CMS or want custom, LAMP or WIMP stack.

For simple one pagers or PPC landers: JS / CSS3/HTML5 / PHP
Thanks

> For big budget clients: WP or if they dont need a CMS or want custom, LAMP or WIMP stack.

How does the logistics work for when a client wants you to build an app for them? Would you create an AWS account, register the domain, get the page live, then give them all the credentials after you're done?

> For simple one pagers or PPC landers: JS / CSS3/HTML5 / PHP

Do you usually need to be an artist using photoshop for these one pagers or is it more layout, design and functionality? Do you find people who want you to create single pages, but use bootstrap or materialize? What about angular or react?(although this seems less realistic of a request)

If I can build basic CRUD apps in LAMP and Rails from scratch, have read read books on html5, css3(new features and how to modularize), have used bootstrap, materialize, angular, some oAuth API's, and deployed on heroku/aws ec2,would there be any clients for me if I started looking for freelancing work? It's so hard not knowing if I'm doing things correctly or if I what I know is enough when you're self taught. 

Sorry for so many questions! Just very curious.
No problem my mango friend!
It really depends upon the client.

If it's just a lander for PPC use. Bill them for the time it takes you to make it(Let's say 25 hours @ $35/hr so $875) + you can make even more by hosting it for them and billing them monthly ($50-$150/m).
> How does the logistics work for when a client wants you to build an app for them? Would you create an AWS account, register the domain, get the page live, then give them all the credentials after you're done?

Basically, yes. I will typically just host it myself and just invoice the client for monthly hosting. More $ for me and long term. If they want control of it all, I build that into the final price.

> Do you usually need to be an artist using photoshop for these one pagers or is it more layout, design and functionality?

More just layout, design, funcrtionality.

>Do you find people who want you to create single pages, but use bootstrap or materialize? What about angular or react?(although this seems less realistic of a request)

Most of the time the clients dont know what they want. I've never really had a client say "I want to use Bootstrap framework!". Most are not that savvy or maybe at most have read a few things online about making a website and still know basically nothing.

> If I can build basic CRUD apps in LAMP and Rails from scratch, have read read books on html5, css3(new features and how to modularize), have used bootstrap, materialize, angular, some oAuth API's, and deployed on heroku/aws ec2,would there be any clients for me if I started looking for freelancing work?

Yes, you can always pickup clients easily. Honestly the best thing to do is goto your local entrepreneur meetups and network. Find local & small business owners who dont have a website or the knowledge to marketing their business online and work for them! Hand out business cards and just be friendly and open and nice.

You got this!
How does the hosting and billing process work?


Pretty simple, you just email them an invoice every month for hosting. If they go past 30 days without payment, you shut off their hosting until they pay.
Thanks. Good to know.
I was really interested in where this article was going, but then it started heading downhill really fast.

Firstly, women suddenly appear in the second section, basically out of nowhere.  This claimed narrative that PHP is a "woman's language" is something that is asserted without any evidence or even anecdote.  I have no idea what the gender usage statistics for various languages are, but I wouldn't even trust them, given different languages tend to be used by entirely different cultures of businesses, all of which have different attitudes to women in the workplace that have little to do with their language and more to do with their history.

Secondly, this post is so patronising.  It's entirely written from the perspective of "us vs them", where "we" have chosen the right language, and now "we" need to go and be nicer to "them" - the poor unfortunates who picked Java or PHP.

That's not just unfair, it's also incredibly lacking in awareness.  It lacks awareness of why companies have chosen to work with Java and PHP, and it lacks awareness of programmers who use both Java/PHP and other languages.  It divides programming society in an entirely meaningless way, given that for many programmers Java is all they need to know, because their job is to write Java code.

Thirdly, the article never even begins to address the fact that these languages - along with literally every single language ever written - has many major flaws that users should definitely be aware of.  Neither does it discuss the fact that these flaws are generally known to the language designers and developers, and that most of them are quite aware of their language's position, goals, and design.  Take PHP for example, a language that is traditionally thought of as riddled with security bugs and shoddy programming.  Except the majority of newly-written PHP programs have access to OO, namespaces, static typing, and libraries specifically designed to minimise security bugs.  The biggest security risks are from old applications in the maintenance cycle of life, and new programmers trying to learn from badly-written StackOverflow answers - neither of which can be solved by the PHP devs.  (That said, there have been attempts to go through old SO questions and try and make sure they do all have secure answers available.)  Or alternatively Java, which is verbose and ugly and "engineering-y" - which is exactly the language that thrives in verbose, ugly engineering environments.

And this criticism is by no means limited to just "lesser" languages - Haskell, whilst beautiful, is so abstract and mathematical that practical enterprise-level programs soon become complex intricate webs that no-one wants to touch.  Or take Javascript, which is so bad that most modern web development has a secondary aim of trying to update the JS language as much as possible, either by writing in a completely different language, or adding every feature they can from other languages.

Why are all these languages used in their situation, despite such contempt and ridicule?  It's not because they're lesser languages, or that their developers aren't good enough, it's because they're usually the best language for that particular job, at that particular time.
> SHUT. UP.

Because that totally fixes problems.
Is php bad, or is it only bad code that gets written in php because of the low barrier to entry?
I'm guilty :-( ... But PHP is objectively a bad language. And I itch to program in it, secretly, just as secretly as we itch some pleasures.... 
Kiddo, don't feel like that. You're just 13, do you know how awesome is to be at your age already knowing programming at that level?

I just took a quick look at your git and seriously, keep going. You're going to be an even more badass programmer (because you're already one) when the right time comes for you.
Okay. A few things:

1. You're 13
2. Have a Github ( with active repos )
3. Have documented code ( And it's actually pretty clean )
4. Are working in a number of languages ( keep expanding! )

You're on the path to be absolutely CRUSHING in a few years. I started coding when I was about 13 with Flash and did that as just fun, nothing even close to what you're doing here already. 15 years later and I am still doing it ( full stack senior dev ) - I am constantly trying to learn and push myself, I am also always doubting the things I am doing.

Don't beat yourself up, if you look at old code and think "wow this is terrible" you're doing good. Always keep learning and growing. You will never write code that you think "this is absolutely perfect and can't get any better" if you do then you've officially become obsolete. My first director always told me "just don't suck", if you think you suck you're doing okay.

You're gonna do great kid, just keep kicking ass and taking names.
When I was 13, all I did was chop yew trees in Runescape. The fact that you have a github, your own website, and a lot of good projects on there is amazing and something to feel great about. 

Btw, I really like your EssayMaker. It could really be useful to some students, especially some who are in ESOL and have a really tough time writing essays. 
Is this a humble brag? You're kicking ass don't be so hard on yourself.
im 22 and a bad developer...and i make good money off it. i think you'll be fine bud. i just discovered porn at the age of 13 
I was going to come in here and say "I drink a lot."

You're 13 so I'm not going to advise you to do the same, but this post is causing me to drink. 13 years old with a github account, jfc.
You need some DJ Khaled
I'm a 30 something year old professional web developer and I feel the same exact way.

Check this out: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome


Go camping.
You should talk to your parents and maybe see a mental health professional. You're going through what a lot of other people go through, especially in software development. Fortunately, there are doctors out there that can and will help you. 

Looking at your work, you're a talented developer, regardless of your age. You don't have to let a health issue like this keep you from the things you love. 


You should change the rainbow background on your portfolio. It's very distracting and makes the text difficult to read.

That said.. I wish I could trade lives with you and be a 13 year old this good at programming. You're definitely going places.
Dude, you're 13 and you're already putting together decent Node projects - and documenting them. I've seen people getting paid close to 100k/yr who write worse code than you've got in your repo, and most of it isn't even open source.

Its really easy to feel bad when measuring yourself against the unicorns (Gates, Zuckerburg, etc.), but in reality its more than sufficient to be in the top 10% - and you're already well on your way there.

As for needing approval, its really easy to get into a feedback loop where you need people commenting on your work to feel validated, and its often something you have to get past to start producing your best work. That said, if you need quick approval, people go gaga over CSS usage innovations, however small - throw together some codepens and a fancy demo site and you'll get tons of gratification to keep yourself motivated.

There's some great advice on this thread already about not worrying about it too much because you're writing good code already at a young age, and also that you've a lifetime of learning more stuff, and so you shouldn't be too hard on yourself.

I'd add another thing - don't pay too much attention to the competitiveness of the industry. Most of us at some point or another have found our minds flitting to the pleasant dream that we're part of the talented 1% that MegaCorp wants to hire, and our sharp-elbowed culture encourages us to think this way. I'd argue this is toxic - only 1% of programmers will fit into the top 1% and those of us in the 99% should practice being fine with this.

Reddit doesn't always help - I'm rather bored of hearing about "six figure salaries", whatever that means outside of the United States (perhaps the writer always means rupees?). I love to hear of programmers who just want to use their craft as a cool hobby rather than a career in the rat race, or maybe someone who _is_ in the rat race uses their tech skills to help a charitable cause for free, or whatever.

(18 stars on one of your repos - pretty good!)

What the hell dude you are seriously my clone. I'm from Portland, OR and started coding when I was 13... except you're a thousand times better than I was at your age. Here's something I wish I read when I was your age: http://www.wisdomination.com/screw-motivation-what-you-need-is-discipline/

Keep up the work dude, you have a bright future ahead of you.
The sad truth is that programming is an exercise rife with negative feedback.  Programmers are their own worst critics, there isn't a line of code on the planet I am prepared to hate more than I hate something I have written myself, after all other code can be written by an amateur but I should know better than that.  We go in to projects specifically looking for the negative, we train ourselves to be highly attuned to things that may result in potential problems.  If these things sound like they may be bad for your overall mental health you need to address them now.

Other than just dropping the idea of coding all together I would suggest you find a way to work where you are reminded of the positive.  Test driven development might be good for you "Here is what success looks like" and "Here I have written something that meets that criteria of success".

I would also like to point out that I believe that we are all [amateurs at heart](https://blog.codinghorror.com/strong-opinions-weakly-held/) on a journey with the unachievable destination of perfection.  That said to avoid the whole analysis paralysis and second guessing thing you kind of have to believe in the decisions you are making.
At 13 you have a GitHub account and you're already programming. I know college seniors that just decided to start that have less than 18 months experience that are getting paid opportunities in and out of school. 

When I was 13 I had no clue what I wanted to do! I played video games all the time, that was my passion then. From 15 to 19 I got really into golf, I was passionate about it and played competitions on an international level by my final year. Then I went to college, I didn't have as much time to practice and decided to pursue other things. Three years later I decided to start designing websites in WordPress, and only two years ago did I actually start programming. Six months after graduating I have a job as a front end web developer and I absolutely love it. 

I know life can be overwhelming at times, or you might feel inadequate because you're not the level you think you should be yet. That's something I struggle with as well. You are doing something you truly enjoy at an early age. A lot of people spend their entire life on autopilot and never achieve what you have at such an early age. My advice to you is this: whatever you do, whether it be programming or something else, care about it and be proud of what you put into and get out of it. Who knows where the future will take you, enjoy it and keep doing you! Sounds like you're way ahead of the curve on the whole life thing!

I'll leave you with this quote from Steve Jobs which has helped me many times in my life.

"You can't connect the dots looking forward. You can only connect them looking backwards so you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future."
Dude, you're 13 and already have more stars on your Github than me (a professional developer working in NYC). Not that stars mean anything, but.. take it as a sign that you're doing fine by adult standards, and are already kickin' major ass next to your peers.

Now go out and build some cool shit. :) 
First of all, yes, you suck as a programmer.  We all do.  You're probably not going to win the IOI.  This year, anyway.  Next year, maybe.  Year after that, maybe even closer.

See, thing is, you're 13.  Find some age-appropriate competition and win it.  Or don't, but you really should pick something more sensical to feel like you're shit at.  If nearly everyone your age isn't at your level, then you probably don't suck all that much.  So I'm *not* a web developer, but I do some web dev on occasion for my personal projects, and sometimes I even have to do (oh no) front-end stuff at work.  My front-end code sucks, and my back-end code... well, for the web dev stuff, it's terrible.  I'm not very good at web development!  (I've written some nice JS apps with the canvas; I think that code is actually pretty decent.  My PHP stuff is really not.)  Do I feel bad about it?  No.  Not at all.  I work hard at improving on the stuff I care about, which are back-end development as well as the actual content of my projects -- one is a music database, and I care much more about the music I transcribe and put in it than the coding for that one.  If you're not very good at something and *want* to be good at it, the thing to do is keep working at it until you're better.  Complaining that you're no good at it isn't going to solve any problems.  Sure, OK, you're no good at it.  Fine.  But if you care, you'll get better.
There's a time for everything.
Now is not your time to think like that.

Learn to relax. Be more social.
Just keep on living, and something good will happen to you someday.
>I really love web development, but I just have trouble feeling good about myself and set high expectations for everything I do. 

You probably don't know it yet, but this is your greatest strength. Never being satisfied with your work will push you into constantly improving. Trust me when I say I wish 90% of the people I've worked with through the years were like you.

The dangerous thing about the internet is that what you see on here is created by the best of the best among *millions* of developers. I get that you want to do great things right away, but don't rush it. Many of the people you're comparing yourself against have been in the business for longer than you have been alive.

Starting out at your age is incredible. By the time you're an adult, you'll be far and beyond your peers. Keep going down this path and you'll have an amazing career waiting for you.
I started at a similar age, and must tell you, don't stress out, most of developers have no idea what they are doing or how their code works.

Just remember to have fun, you wouldn't want to grow up and work at something which is not fun :p
Look, you're 13, no one is judging you for your programming skills and if they are they are more than likely projecting their own insecurities about their skills. I wish I was programming at your age, you probably have a really good start at understanding how to work and all you need to do is keep pushing yourself to learn more and just program as much as possible. I'd probably be more worried if you graduated with a degree in cs and had these feelings but your young and not even through high school. You have a lot of time and work a head of you. Do you feel this way because you are struggling with new concepts or just feel insecure? Either way bud you seem to be on the right track to me.
Sweat it off bro, your brain is not even close to be fully developed and you already code really good. 
I think you have some kind of depression,  IDK how is your life but maybe you are too focused in programming that you are leaving aside things that a 13 year old do (it is not bad to be focused is bad when it start to affect other aspects of your life). A 13 year old should be worrying about others aspects of life, not about how good is at programming, save those stressful thoughts for later.
If you're not constantly worried that you're not doing it right then you're doing it wrong. This shit is hard and there are so many ways to do it. I doubt myself every day and i have been doing it for 14 years. Keep your chin up mate you're gonna be fine.
Takes about ten years too become an expert. You could hit that by twenty. Make sure to develop your social and physical skills as well. 
Keep going. You'll be flying in a few years. Your code is better than some of my old coworkers' and they are 20+ years old.
I'm 14, and if you need any help, feel free to PM me. Github [@nmcae](http://github.com/nmcae)
Hey there,

Your issues isn't programming skill its negative self-talk. It could help by reading up on a few books on improving your thought processes by positive thinking and not being hard on yourself.

Check out the following subreddits 
 
[https://www.reddit.com/r/GetDisciplined+selfimprovement+ZenHabits+Manprovement+LiveLife+PsychologicalTricks+DecidingToBeBetter+Productivity+SelfHelp+Psychology](https://www.reddit.com/r/GetDisciplined+selfimprovement+ZenHabits+Manprovement+LiveLife+PsychologicalTricks+DecidingToBeBetter+Productivity+SelfHelp+Psychology) and maybe check there for advice also.
Depression and self esteem are complex and none of us know your circumstances; however, they are often a symptom of larger issues, rather than the root issues themselves. You mention setting high expectations for yourself, which is something I can relate to, so I'll offer some advice there. I'm on my third year of therapy working on this, among other things, and I'm finally figuring out how to make it work for me.

So for one, it's good you recognize you do this. That means you can work on it. Give yourself credit.

I set impossibly high expectations for myself; goals that I can never meet. If I do somehow achieve those goals, there's always something wrong that I can pick at. This is pretty self-defeating. So what's the solution? Set lower expectations. Of course that's easier said than done, but if you apply some rigorous approaches to your goals, it's not so overwhelming.

Say, for example, you want to complete an entire website as quickly as possible. You think you can do it in a single work day (8 hours), but it might take you 10 hours. Great, so you have an ideal goal you'd like to achieve. Now look at what you *need* to achieve. Work granted you 3 work days to finish the site, so you instantly know you're already holding yourself to too high of an expectation, and one of your own manufacture.

Now, you can break your single expectation down into multiple goals that you can achieve. Make the goals some that you feel are high-achieving that you know you can complete within any time constraints. Challenge yourself, but don't set yourself up to fail. Perhaps you can take time to learn a library in 3 hours instead of wrapping up a feature in 30 minutes. Once you accomplish the goal, congratulate yourself for achieving it and *move on*. You're done! Don't nitpick it. You just allowed yourself to meet an impossible standard you set up for yourself.

After doing this for a while (and I mean over a number of months) failure to meet impossible standards won't contribute to your depression and self-esteem. This is because you'll stop setting yourself up for failure, and the goals you've set for yourself you will have actually achieved.

There are other minor things you can do too. Have you worked 8 hours that day and you're tired? Go home, tell yourself that you worked hard that day, and don't tell yourself that you can keep going; you can't; you're human. If your flow disrupted? Go use the restroom, get a cup of water, and step away for a few minutes to unwind while your mind is already distracted.

Anyway, hope this is helpful and makes sense. I'm on a NyQuil diet right now.
I won't comment on your web stuff, because your git is very nice as others have already commented.

But I will say, as someone who graduated high school when they were 13 and then got their master's by 19, I've been where you are. Other people your age just aren't there yet. Give it time, stuff smooths out. Also, I had (and still have, although greatly improved) this awful problem where I see dumber people as inferior. Word of advice: don't develop that issue, haha.
Hey I just wanted to say that you have asked a really great question. 

It's unfortunately too common to question our abilities and deny our own achievements, whether 13 or 33. The only assurance I can offer is that you aren't alone! I highly recommend reading up on [impostor syndrome](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Impostor_syndrome). Here's another article [21 Proven Ways To Overcome Impostor Syndrome](http://startupbros.com/21-ways-overcome-impostor-syndrome/). 
A lot of what you read will be angled towards workplace environments, but is applicable to school and online communities too. Best of luck, I wish I had known about all of this stuff at 13 :) 
Jesus dude, I'm 15 and you know more than I do already. You're smart, especially for a 13 year old. You're gonna absolutely smash it in a few years, gonna be working at the top.
You're my brother's age and you can code better than I do (I'm 19, self-taught and no longer in school)!

It's been mentioned already somewhere, but are there any competitions for young people involving coding/robotics near you? Give them a shot!
I wish I could offer some advice. I feel the exact same way and I'm 20. I've been programming for good 4 years now. I had to change majors away from CS because I couldn't handle it. But you're young and have a fresh mind don't give up like I did. 
I am 36 and I feel the same way. Not only are you ahead of me programming wise also the level of maturity is astounding. Thank you for the question. You have identified a feeling and a perspective that I am just now realizing my self. So like many others have written you are way way ahead of the curve. To answer your question what works for me is growing confidence in your self, understanding that you don't know everything and that some time you will have to ask for help, that's okay. Also doing something simply because you want to, not for anyone else. Hard lesson to learn but you will get it.
What you're going through is normal for your age. It will pass, don't let it get to you.  

You're doing the best you can. That is what matters the most. That is what makes a person great.
Wanna add. If you want a realistic judgement of your skills: Get a few freelance projects and get paid.  
When someone pays you - it means they value you enough to give you cash. And the amount shows how much they value you
> Have documented code ( And it's actually pretty clean )

Haha, doing better than me and my work. I'm actively discouraged from adding comments.

I guess the code doesn't really need it though, our unit tests are sort of our documentation.
To be fair RS was the shit back in the days, and those yew didn't chop themselves.
That's the whole idea of the project! I used to have trouble with that as a younger kid so I built it to help others!
I wish I was bragging. I'm really hard on myself psychologically, and it's a habit of the environment I grew up in.
That truth, hahaha
He wants to lower the esteem of older programmers lol
I swear to god. I'm much older and I'm trying to learn webdev and this kid is insane. 
Ah, yes, the drinking. 
lion order, lion order, another one, another one, another one

major key alert !!! we the best
I APPRECIATE YA
It's true, one thing I wish I learned when I was younger, but something that probably comes with age for most people, is how to pursue a goal with discipline and be patient.

With talent and discipline you can truly do amazing things.  And OP has talent, so with discipline to continuously improve himself and the patience to see it through, he could really be what people call "top talent".

Discipline is something that's hard to grasp I think.  It's not something I fully understood the importance of until after 25 or so.  I was always the "smart slacker" that took school/etc for granted and never truly did anything worthwhile.
It's a bit of both honestly. I think it's part of the high expectations I set for myself that are unreasonable.
>not farming magic trees.  

Pls..
I hear that, man, and it's tough. You're ridiculously talented and obviously very passionate, and those two things can honestly kinda suck in combination sometimes. I'm 10 years older than you but what you're describing is how I feel most days.  

Let the feelings you have push you to try new things. When you feel down, put aside what you're working on and try something different â€“ learn a new language, try out a new tool, make a completely pointless CSS animation. Don't think of these things as distractions; think of them as finding new breadth to your knowledge â€“ which, again, is already amazing.

And when that isn't enough, when you still feel down, try something *completely* different. There's so much more in life than code. When I can't possibly make myself write another line, I stop. I do something else â€“ go for a bike ride, work on music, cook a meal. Not saying those things would work for you, but find something else to dump your incredible amount of passion into.  

The biggest thing you have going for you is your age, honestly. You have *so* much time to figure out what you want to do â€“ and *so* much time to actually do those things. But don't get so caught up in what you're doing, so much as *why* you're doing it. You're doing it because you care enough to do a kick-ass job.

Sorry if this rambled, but I feel like I'm talking to myself 10 years ago â€“ the difference being that I'm 23 and I wrote my first gulpfile four months ago.
He is right, as  a 13 yo I was playing CoD... not that I'm way older, now I just play other games
"I only have five repos with more than five stars at the age of 13. Should I kill myself?"
YU SMAHT
> It's a bit of both honestly. I think it's part of the high expectations I set for myself that are unreasonable.

that's part of life. i think you're gonna be fine. 
Think about these expectations and why you hold them. You have a lot of insight and self reflection, enough to realize that your expectations are unreasonable. Now you just need to calm your mind enough to a point where you can resolve them somehow.

Have you tried meditating and exercise? 
Social programming... Great.
Not sure if making fun, but I appreciate the sentiment anyway lol
U LOOYAL
AS A MATTER A FACT, YUU A GEENIUS
Erlang to build the authentication service. Clojure for most of the domain logic. I'd roll my own HTTP server in Brainfuck. Of course relational databases are SOOO 1972...gotta roll with Apache Accumulo for storage. And of course all of the cutscenes would be scripted using Lua.

In reality, it depends on the requirements of the project. Is it a simple web-app for a small business? If so, you could use any of the three languages you mentioned and be just fine. Whichever language your engineers are most comfortable with should suffice.

If you're planning on building a global software-as-a-service business where scalability becomes a concern, then you really need to do some more thorough analysis of the project requirements. There is no one-size-fits-all solution.
For what you're describing I wouldn't focus on the language as much, but look at frameworks that can help you complete your tasks in the most efficient way.  What gives you the best database tools?  The best security/auth tools? What makes it the easiest to build a REST API on?  You're describing very common web application tasks so you want to be DRY and put more time into architecting and implementing your application in the best way possible.

In PHP you could use something like Symfony or Laravel, in Python you could use Django, and in Node you could use Meteor or even just Express with something like Passport.  So look at them all and determine which you're the most comfortable with and which one is going to get you to a minimum viable product the fastest.  At the end of the day your code is going to largely be the same no matter which one you go with.  I personally like PHP and Laravel, but that's mostly because I'm lazy and don't like wasting time on server setups.
[deleted]
I don't like curly braces, so I use python.
Just work with the language you enjoy the most. That's why when it's up to me I use Python for the backend even though I have a lot more experience using JS.
I write node apps and php apps for a living.  At this point I enjoy node more because it's new, it's shiny and it is a bit more challenging.

However, I would probably choose php for most projects if it were up to me. This is due to me being in a location where finding good programers is hard and my belief that Node is more of a liability than other languages.  It's REALLY easy to write leaky code in javascript, even if you know what you are doing, and a vast number of "node developers" don't know what they are doing.

Client side js memory leaks seldom reveal themselves but on the server side where every single request is ran by the same process within the same memory pool this can become a problem fast.  One small memory leak in node will degrade the performance of your app over time until eventually the process crashes.

In php it's REALLY hard to write leaky code.  Couple that with the fact that each request is ran in it's own process, with it's own memory pool, and exists for literally milliseconds before it is destroyed makes it a lot more forgiving.  Especially when you are dealing with a lot of junior devs which my company relies heavily upon.

People will use the argument that node is faster than php as the reason to use it.  If thats the basis for use than all node developers should switch to Go.  Our end users will find no visible difference in speed between our php apps and node apps except when we are trying to find leaks in our node apps.  In this case node becomes visibly slower.  NGINX can serve requests much faster than Express or even your favorite Go server.  Couple this with php7-fpm and you can write apps with incredibly fast backends.

At the end of the day you can build fantastic web apps in any modern language: Go, Node, php, Ruby, Python, C#, Coldfusion etc...  Pick the language thats best suited to your team and so long as you all know what you are doing you should be fine.
I'd go for django myself because it is so productive and solid for these general dynamic websites/apis.

And using the recent versions of all the stack (django 1.9, python 3.5, postgres 9.4 and redis/nginx/whatever) it is a very fun way to build stuff.

I like ES6 too but python 3 is so pleasant and smooth. I don't like PHP at all, it's like they went for the complete opposite of python's zen. I won't touch it with a pole unless prod is down with the PHP guys MIA (drunk and in tears probably).

We still use old-skool sync python/django over something async because the combination is so insanely productive you solve things at other levels (everything is all about caching anyway). 

Node's async is pretty cool using ES6, promises and streams and all but there is nothing to fully replace django yet. We do use Node for websockets though, but as a slim server talking to the django API's.

With Node we don't like how you need to locate and assemble ten thousand micro-modules to have your basic general-purpose maintainable backend functionality you get out of the box with django. We don't mind the chunky monolithic frameworks if it is long-term dependable. And django is just that; we've maintained some apps over years and a whole bunch of versions.
Rails, it's solid, tested, and you can make apps super fast with it. 
I had to get embarrassingly far into this post before I realised what was going on lol
Agreed. Putting your comment another way, pretty much everything is a one-size-fits-all solution until you hit either extraordinary requirements or extraordinary scale.

Turns out the right tool for the job is usually the good enough tool that you already know.
Thanks! I am most comfortable with PHP and Python so am leaning towards PHP/Laravel or Python/Django or Flask.

I have been wanting to dive more into Node and part of me feels this would be a good chance to do that but I may stick to what I know.
Yeah.. as someone who was learning both from 0... 

When I first made a mini laravel project, took me a little to get everything working right but I eventually got it.

Had a good time making a meteor app, but then when it came time to deploy it I felt like I wanted to hit my head on a wall if I couldn't use one of the auto-solutions for node..
Or Python with Django if he's going with a larger framework like that. From what I understand it's similar to RoR (Have only done like 1 tutorial with rails a while ago, so maybe that's inaccurate).

OP, like others have said, it depends on the use case, if those are your preferred languages, I'd personally recommend Django/Python for the Web component, and NodeJS on the side if you have any real time services / high concurrency you want to support (like a chat room or a socket server, etc).

From my Experience Django is pretty pleasant to work with and does a lot for you.
A week?!

If you're using gems that stuff can be set up within an hour, two max. Even rolling your own shouldn't take that long.

I'm assuming you're a busy guy and are doing this in your free time. :p
Great answer! Thanks for this.
I disagree. Ruby is falling out of favor fast and you will have a harder time finding a job.

Php is ubiquitous, you will find jobs with it.
Python is great for scientific and data heavy operations.
Node is sexy and forward thinking. Go here if you wanna be a cutting edge hipster baller.

Really though, they all work fine.
If you have no technical preference I advice you to consider the language you use. Which one do you want to spend time in?
Thanks for this. It won't have any real-time chat like stuff. It will be a SaaS B2B app that will service 3000+ users its first year. Most of the activity will be add/edits from these users and querying data (reports).

What are your thoughts on Django vs Flask?
Or ASP.NET MVC which is similar to Rails and Django just in C#.

At the end of the day all languages/stacks have their strengths and weaknesses and often the decision on which one to pick is more about the project and environment around it. I'm a software architect, my job is to figure out which stack/language works best for a project and how to implement the project in a way that is testable, maintainable and cost effective. Often the decision comes down to my team, the devops culture in the company, and project requirements. Django, Rails and ASP.NET MVC are all fine MVC frameworks, I'd be looking for  the skills we have, the servers we have and packages available from the community (all 3 have a healthy package ecosystem that is open source).
It's only falling out of favor for companies willing to adopt new risky technologies. Sometimes it's best to have somethign that's rock solid and you know it works. I work with Rails and have had several offers working with that tech. I do admit PHP demand might be bigger, or Node, but Rails is more than enough for a willing dev to make a living out of it and be happy in the process :P
I haven't done anything with Flask project wise, but from what I've read / heard about: Django is your bigger full application framework that will handle a lot for you, and Flask is the smaller lightweight option that lets you build more of the things yourself.

That said I really do enjoy Django and haven't had a reason to spend time learning a new framework (yet), I will probably try Flask at some point though.
For what you've mentioned I'd go with Django, already has the stuff you require built in and everything is laid out for you. Flask would require a bit more tinkering.
I don't think it's about being willing to adopt risky technology at all.. Node is not risky. Wal mart has run it through multiple Black Fridays.

That being said for someone starting out you need to be forward thinking. What will the landscape look like in five years? I don't think ruby will be very relevant then.
I hope django-channels works out in practice so we can so server-push, sockets and http2 using same patterns as our django http.
What? I doubt we are talking about the same industry. Rails is nowhere near dead. Trendy techs are great until you have a problem they were not designed to solve. A lot of companies jumped into the NoSQL bandwagoon with things like MongoDB and ended up swapping back to Posgres. 

Node is great but, when you have a new hammer, everything looks like a nail.
I didn't say Rails was dead - I said it wasn't relevant.

There will always be legacy projects, and there will still be companies doing new work in Rails. But similar to cold fusion - Ruby is no longer a darling language. It has several limitations and its benchmarking is pretty bad. 

Contrast that with PHP - which also has some language issues, and doesn't crush benchmarking. BUT Ruby devs are much harder to find, and demand a higher wage than PHP. PHP is ubiquitous, so companies will continue to utilize it.

Contrast this with Node. Node crushes Ruby in nearly all benchmarking. It isn't an arbitrary choice. There are real and significant gains to be had in not only performance, but also architecture.

I fail to see why, given the options, Ruby is a good choice. Similarly, I wouldn't recommend a new dev focus on cold fusion. There are totally still cold fusion jobs and cold fusion systems in production, but looking forward, it's clear that that's not the way we're headed.

>Trendy techs are great until you have a problem they were not designed to solve. A lot of companies jumped into the NoSQL bandwagoon with things like MongoDB and ended up swapping back to Posgres.

This is a totally unrelated example. Choosing NoSQL arbitrarily is an awful choice - just like choosing any language arbitrarily is an awful choice. NoSQL systems have their place, but RDBS are still around for good reason.

What is the reason to use Ruby? Other than that you already know it? What doe sit provide that sets it ahead of the competitors? Why choose Ruby over PHP / Python / Node - because to choose it at the stage where you're just starting out as a dev, you need to beat all competitors at your given use case.
Comparing Ruby to Coldfusion? For real? I don't even... :P 
Don't take me wrong, I like PHP and Javascript, and I've worked with PHP and Javascript for more than 8 years and built several systems, but still, It's not like PHP or Node is the only valid choice.

Node is in fact much faster than PHP and Ruby, but the application is rarely the bottleneck. Rails gives you faster development times, and with a well configured server is competent with any other tech, GitHub uses Rails in production and it does just fine, so performance is a silly excuse, also, "premature optimization is the root of all evil" :) Using Node just because it's fast might be a not good enough reason to use it.

> This is a totally unrelated example. Choosing NoSQL arbitrarily is an awful choice - just like choosing any language arbitrarily is an awful choice. 

Seems like we agree on something! 

> What is the reason to use Ruby? Other than that you already know it? What doe sit provide that sets it ahead of the competitors?

This is blog post material, all techs have their strong and weak points. Personally, I know all of them but Python, and I think they are all equally valid as a starting point. Knowledge is transfearable, the important thing is just learn something and build stuff with it.

I think Rails biggest strength is how fast you can build apps, I think it has the biggest plug-and-play library of components for developers to use. But even if you don't think that way, and you think library support is just as good as other technologies, the language itself is a joy to use. Maybe it's just personal preference but OOP a-la Smalltalk feels quite good.
I've recently been working on a rota system and would say this, dates can be a pain.

If you would be partial to Wordpress, something like: https://en-gb.wordpress.org/plugins/booking-system/ would make it pretty easy
Take it from someone who has done it: Definitely don't build a booking system from scratch unless you're going to be using it in lots of products/projects. There's just too much pain involved.

It's good to remember that this is a common thing and there are lots of people who have spent lots of time building and maintaining good products.

We had* to write one for a client last year. It was exceptionally time consuming and not at all financially fruitful. This was for one of those very typical "relatively simple" projects we all spend so much time doing.

We spend a lot of time maintaining the thing when we could be doing anything else.

*okay, we didn't "have to". The project owner bungled this and and a few other decisions and lost their job.
I'll take a look. Thanks 
Thanks for the insight. Yeah I try to avoid pain, enough seems to happen on its very own. 
Unless who ever manages it is decent at it i would use a 3rd party service.  Google does it but don't think its free.

If you only want a few mail accounts then [zoho](https://www.zoho.com/) might be a decent option *edit* for free.
Set them up with gmail. They get apps and spam protection for $5 a month. Well worth it imo
Most shared hosting providers will give you unlimited free email accounts and you don't have to mess with extra costs or the maintenance.  Look into companies like InMotion and see if what they offer fits the bill.  Otherwise you're looking at something like $5/mth for Google Business or for an account directly from the domain registrar.  Hover offers a 10GB mailbox for $20/yr.  https://www.hover.com/email
Is he a US Secretary of State? Then definitely not.
Google Apps is $5/month per user. It pretty much handles everything and affordable. I'd recommend it.
I got 1 paragraph into reading before I got a modal asking me if I wanted a free t-shirt... I instantly closed the tab.
I got 1 paragraph into reading before that site broke my up and down keyboard arrows, which I was using for scrolling, by popping up a newsletter subscription bar AND forcing my keyboard focus on it.

I'm not taking any design tips from a site made like that...
You can do it three ways that I know of. 

1) write an alias or DNS map for it

2) create a blank page that supports an iframe and embed the other hosted site there. 

3) forwarding/redirect with masking 
Any idea why the client wants it setup this way?
I may be mistaken, but I think the only way to accomplish this is through the use of subdomains.
Yes it is, with the right equipment. Our load balancers at work can read the URLs and direct the request to the right server based on that. You could also right a page for your server (php, node, pretty much whatever) that acts as a proxy. Apache actually has a standard module for exactly that.
Can you give me an example?
Yeah - because the server is running Drupal on a dedicated environment and a separate team manages a repo for this other part of the site. Ridiculous, I know.
What module?
Of which of the three?
Dude, just use Cloudflare and create a page rule or a CNAME and you can send people wherever you like.
mod_proxy
Of forwarding with masking, please? I would google this but I'm unsure what to Google. Thanks!
That's a great idea, thanks!
You can Google "domain forwarding with masking"  :) 

The steps vary a little depending on your registrar, but under your domain choose "forward / mask" and set it as 301 Permanent Redirect. You can forward only or forward with masking at that point, and choose what to mask such as title/description/keyword/etc. 
No probs
Thanks! sorry for being a noob.
Isn't masking just a frame? 
No problem at all! That's what we are here for :)
A frame? It's page forwarding 
Then how is the URL being masked?
Not an engineer so I'm not sure how it "works" - I just push the button and config the settings. 
What stack are you developing for? I would definitely use visual studio code, if you're doing LAMP stack I would say virtualbox with vagrant. If you're doing .NET, Visual Studio 2015 Community is a must, with either IIS or IIS express. 

Hard to say without more info on your project, though
What OS?
What I use is Adobe CC, a quick Image Resizer, Notepad++, Xampp, Color Picker, Filezilla, Chrome, Edge, Firefox. Nothing special. 
[deleted]
Use the search function cheers
lamp development on windows was absolutely miserable.  I strongly second using a vm for this, will save you soo much heartache.
Sorry but i am unfamiliar with the term stack..as stated I am a Noob of sorts. Only just starting to code my sites
Windows 10, I am looking to build a new pc in the coming weeks and that'll be windows also. 
I hate that Adobe CC Has monthly subscriptions.....I mean there are other means, but hypothetically I could see myself having issues finding copies with a crack that works.. would CS6 Dreamweaver be okay?  Ive never really used it at all but I like the access to jquery libraries and the live previews. I should mention im a bit if a Noob but I'm  learning
Paint.net?  I'll have to check it out
The stack is simply the server config and software that you use. .NET is Microsoft, LAMP is Linux, Apache (server software), MySQL, PHP. 

In this day in age, there are a ton more options, but those categories are still used. 

I work in .NET and I have a volunteer project using WordPress (LAMP). I prefer .NET, personally. 
Dreamweaver sucks. You should use Notepad or Atom or brackets. They all have plugin support and there are live preview plugins available. 
I use notepad ++ at the moment, just thought Dreamweaver might be okay whilst learning? Maybe a bit faster?
Maybe it works for you. Just try what you like :) Have you looked into W3schools yet? It's really the best website to learn webdevelopment. 
I only came across it last night when looking for some code examples.  I have a pair of really good Books (http://www.htmlandcssbook.com/) the first is just HTML and CSS and then there is one on Javascript and Jquery.  Haven't got into the second yet
Other than react, I would propose aurelia, vue.js or angular 2.
Postgres/Express/Redux/React

or 

Meteor
> popular

Popular != good.

Have a good look at Durandal and Aurelia.
If you want something simpler and not so opinionated, I would recommend Backbone.
Sorry, rather than popular I should have said, industry used
People keep leaving off the "unless you are running a supported OS that doesn't run IE11" part.

https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle#gp/Microsoft-Internet-Explorer
Can't wait to read this headline every week for the next year.
They're not dead until no one uses them any more. End of support != end of product.
Thank the gods. Though I'll still have to make our site i.e. 8 compatible since some of our business partners are not allowed to upgrade to a new version yet -_- good old corporate. Maybe this year we might get lucky...
All this means is that users get a message asking them to upgrade. If you're on a corporate PC, you may not have security privileges to do that. And if you're at home, chances are you're on IE 11, Chrome or a newer browser anyway.
I've only heard this 200x already over the past 2 years. It isn't going to happen. While support may drop, users won't. Too many legacy systems running old share point sites, old legacy custom systems that were built by an offshore team 5 years ago, dealing with offshore companies that are still running XP...we still have awhile before our businesses totally give up on old IE. 
My company finally stop supporting ie8 last month.... slowly moving forward......
And all I had to do was throw water on my computer. On wait. SHIT!
Not being supported and getting luddites to actually download a modern browser are two entirely different things. 
I'm just glad that people are finally catching on. I used to hate when Chrome first came out and having to reply to mass emails about my new look to my site not working. Come to find out they were using IE6 and above. Used to be very enraged about this always replying with "Just use Google Chrome".
Long live BrowserStack!
Seriously. Vista end of support is April 11, **2017**. Plus there's all of their embedded systems (for what those matter).

What's happening now is great news, but IE 8-10 aren't dead yet, just really seriously wounded.
Because that part isn't relevant.  The users who won't upgrade to IE11 for other reasons dwarf those who "are running a supported OS that doesn't run IE11".  

I mean seriously, Vista's market share is tiny so it makes more sense to discuss those enterprises that will pay MS to continue supporting older versions of IE.

And if you are writing for the consumer market, it is realistic to say that new projects can ignore versions of IE < 11, even if this means that you can't support a tiny portion of the market for a little while, and this is a big deal!
At first, I was like "REJOICE, EVERYONE", and then I saw this. My hopes and dreams.. crushed.
But still we'd have to wait unless the IE user share goes down drastically. Certainly, this news will trigger the start for that situation to happen.
I don't think that's an apples-to-apples comparison.

There are a lot of corporate Windows XP computers which are forced to use IE6-8 for various dumb IT reasons.

I'm not entirely convinced that the same problem exists with Windows 7. Maybe it does and I just haven't heard about it because it hasn't become the "holdout" population yet. But my suspicion is that this isn't going to be the case because there are two ways a computer's running Windows 7.

1. It's run Windows 7 from the start. In this case, it's recent enough that (hopefully) the people setting it up are no longer foolish enough to require IE.
2. It's been upgraded to Windows 7. If an IT department is willing and able to upgrade the OS, I'm betting that they're not tied down to a specific version of IE.

Either way, I don't see Windows 7 users being tied down to IE nearly as much as XP was.

EDIT: Too lazy to replace 7 with Vista, so assume all references I made were to Vista.
But this is the start :D
> They're not dead until no one uses them any more. 

Why do you need to support every user?  It depends on your target market - if you write a government website then yes, but for most new consumer applications that is unnessary.
if Microsoft doesn't support them anymore, I don't have to either. 
I'm curious, when these big companies upgrade from something like IE6 in 2016, do they go for like.. IE 7 or something? Or do they actually go for the most recent version at that point?
One thing I give full credit to Chrome for is that it silently and automatically is always up to date. There is no supporting "Chrome 10" or whatever, it's just Chrome.
I'm working on an agency project for a huge American corporation's consumer site, and just this morning we received word from them that our project could drop IE 10 support. It's not completely dead, but the death throes have already begun.
On the plus side, almost no one uses Vista anymore (and most skipped it anyway). Unfortunately Server 2008 and 2012 (non-R2 versions) are still good for a while longer I think.
Some people avoid change at all costs. They will be around for years
They can be dead to you, your agency, your company, etc. But for them to be dead as a whole and for forever, they need to not be used by anyone anywhere.
I'd consider it if you still get a lot of traffic from users using them. Unless you're fine with not tailoring to them at all. That's your decision.
they upgrade to the latest if they can. if they're going to upgrade/install something new, they might as well go for the latest, assuming there aren't security implications. (n.b. some of those old versions of IE were modded to meet their businesses needs)
Depends on how much value the browser version has compared to the expense of maintaining support. 

Most of the time it is a monetary decision. If every developer has to spend and extra 10% of their time testing a specific browser versions then that version will be dropped if the money generated from those users falls below the cost of paying developers. 

The decision could also be based other factors like user contributions. If a large portion of submitted content comes from older browsers, you won't be dropping them any time soon. 

Tldr; revenue - cost = profit but this isn't always measured in dollars. 


> years

I hope not man.
I feel like the people who don't make the switch, even after the dropped support from Microsoft, simply don't care to have a better internet experience. With that in mind, it shouldn't matter to us web developers :)
A lot of people can't because they have to run some modded proprietary version for some reason or other
Your talking about support, but he said when they upgrade. Like when a company upgrades its internal network. This is almost always going to be to the latest version. What a company supports for its customers is a different story.
lol. my clients still use ie7. they promised us they'd switch this past summer. they didn't.
Some simply aren't aware of any of it.
I feel your pain.
Sorry to hear that. Maybe it's time to switch clients. 
Once you get used to it, making stuff for ie isn't that bad. I complained about it for a year (IE8 though) and now it's no problem. You just have to remember that things don't need to be fluid/responsive with IE. Just hardcode everything. Worst case scenario use jQuery for fancy stuff.
i've been begging me bosses to give them an ultimatum but they haven't yet. too charitable.
That's all fine and dandy, I can get most things to render so that they're at least usable in IE whatever, but a lot of 3rd party widgets have dropped support for IE7 and even IE8 so....I can't use those libs at all, and that's a problem.
Then you're fucked. I don't really use front-end libs much. 
Is it even possible to get a remote job as an entry level developer other than freelancing?
Node.js, angular, react are the hot kids on the block. Learning JavaScript is a must and I'd recommend transpilers like typescript, coffeescript or haxe
My belief is that due to the impending signs of Node's increasing importance (Wordpress, I'm looking at you), JS is and will be a big deal. Note: I'm not endorsing this, but for better or for worse, I think it's the truth.

But yeah, obviously get yer html and css outta the way before that shit.
I think for an entry level Developer Typescript, Coffeescript or Haxe are a really bad idea.

Learn the fundamentals of JS first, get to the end of what you can do with plain'o JS before jumping on another language/abstraction/transpiler.

I'd even warn away from Babel and ES6 for a beginner.
Most agencies will probably want around 10-15k. Freelancers maybe 5k. You could probably find a beginner to do it for around 1.5-2k, but the quality and development speed might suffer.
Wordpress for a project like this is a horrible idea, you have so many specific requirements and WP is a blogging platform. 

It isn't too much to ask of one person, I think its the perfect size for one person personally. This seems fairly complex so as for price  it would take 2-3 weeks of a skilled developers time; as a lump sum in the ball park of 3-5k.
You will have to find a  person who knows Wordpress and Paypal's API. There aren't that many people that I know who can do both and seamlessly integrate them together.
You can go for either Woocommerce or Magento with a responsive layout.Which city do you live in?
Using Wordpress for the blog and website makes sense. Are you really going to code your own blog and comments system when you can just install Wordpress? You could create the API and reporting code separate from Wordpress but as it seems fairly simple then just dropping it into a plugin will be fine and not cause any issues. 

The complexity and price depends on how many calls you need to make to the API and how much data manipulation and formatting is required to generate a report. There are lots of existing libraries for reports and creating PDFs so it is just a case of using an appropriate one.

If you build some really good detailed specs you can get this done for a reasonable price but if you don't have a really clear use case then expect the developer to charge more.
In regards to Wordpress, I figured as much. What do you think a better platform would be?
I'm in Connecticut (cities are kind of irrelevant here).
Building your own platform using a framework such as Symfony, Laravel or similar would be your best bet.
Nah i was just thinking if you are in the same city we could easily meetup and go through the details.
Laravel would be my pick for the logic, if you are tied a bit to wordpress for the blog you can always use wp-api to get your posts into your main Laravel App
Lol, thanks. 
Interestingly, type attributes aren't:
https://jsfiddle.net/e5cuko4w/1/
I assume you fixed a problem and that was the solution? 
As a point of clarification, [CSS itself is case-insensitive](http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/syndata.html#characters), but HTML4 and 5 specify that [id and class identifiers are case-sensitive](http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/struct/global.html#id-and-class).
But why isn't the "blue" blue
Yes, which is why you can use naming conventions where PascalCase means something else than camelCase.

I use PascalCase for my "components" and camelCase for their parts.
What's the strategy behind  naming classes? 
That's why I always use lower case for almost everything.
me2 thanks.
Indeed, in the same way that if I have HTML like that:

    <div id="#div" data-episodeID="1"></div>

 
This code would be valid

    $('#div').data('episodeid') // returns 1

    document.querySelector('[data-episodeid]') // Returns the correct node
haha, yeah. I had done a find + replace on a document which was just making a word uppercase. Turns out, I used that word within a CSS selector and it had removed all styling on that element.
because there are no CSS rules applying it. But the classes are similar, aside from the case.
I agree, although it's not 'Clean Code' to have the same names albeit different cases for two separate items.
it's an on-going debate between developers, however, I believe the favored approach is all lowercase and using hyphens over underscores:

    .class-name-1 {
        prop: val;
    }
Yeah, seems like attribute names are case-insensitive, whereas the only attribute value that's not case-sensitive is the type attribute value. Why? No clue.
I know, I was just teasing. 
Well, that generally doesn't happen because component names usually don't have any overlap with names you'd use for their parts.
thanks dude

Check out [BEM](http://getbem.com/introduction/)
I don't believe certification is a requirement at all in order to switch to web development. It's great that you've already been getting your hands dirty and immersing yourself in the subject. That shows your enthusiasm for the work.

Certainly in my case, my portfolio combined with my enthusiasm in the interview is what landed me the job. I also re-designed the homepage of the company I was interviewing for, as it wasn't responsive at the time. Demonstrating this on my phone during the interview earned me serious browny points.

If you show initiative and drive, combined with examples of your work, this should be enough to land you your first job. At least that's what I found in my case. My suggestion is to create a portfolio website and get examples of your work up online as evidence of what you can do. Get projects on Github too.

I have previously written a blog post on my experience with switching careers and successfully landing a web development job at the end of it, if you are interested in a first-hand account:

No problem, and thanks for the kind words.

Almost definitely you will need a junior position. My actual job title is not "junior" but I still consider myself as such, just because I'm still only starting out. You will probably find, as I did, that even when you're just looking for junior positions you will still see plenty of jobs that require one or more years experience already! I guess you can argue you are still junior after that length of time, but it does make it more difficult. It would be nice if junior was simply reserved for those looking for their very first role.

Anyway... nice clean sites, seem to work well for me. Maybe try and produce one or two more with a bit more variety? They are similar designs right now. Please take my advice with a pinch of salt though, I literally have no idea what employers/recruiters are specifically looking for when it comes to portfolios. Hmmm maybe some research is in order!
These are cool, could be really useful in some lighter weight projects intending to keep line count down. Other than that, I don't really see the use.
Pretty cool, but wasn't able to get the Twitter link to work using that method at all.
It is more about reducing the page load time. It saves loading external files, is inlined, and also is quite small. Also, a few other versions of share buttons sometimes just don't work without JavaScript, this has at least some form of fallback. 
if you are working on local files that begin file:// then twitter decides to stop it. If it's not that, then can you post an example?
As I said, lightweight projects
[Here is the code snippet:](https://github.com/alexheil/noisaea/blob/master/app/views/partials/_share.html.erb)

[And here is it in action:](http://www.noisaea.com/posts/crush-holiday-music-sales)

I did change it from the one you had, which just displayed a blank page. This was the closest I could get it. It would be great to get this to work because it's exactly what I'm looking for.
Ah. Then yes. I agree. 
I don't think you need to add a site four times into Google tools, I'm pretty sure Google sees them all as the same site.  It also really doesn't matter if you load the site using www or not, as long as the DNS records both point to the same location you're good.
Google has previously stated: 

> Make sure you add both "www" and "non-www" versions for your site. Also, if you use the HTTPS protocol, add those variations as well.

> At Auth0 we care about maintainability and performance.

LOL. If y'all would care about performance you wouldn't hide the content and then show it via JS. Currently, it takes 3.7 seconds before the content shows up even though the document and CSS were already done 3 seconds earlier.

You artificially increased the perceived loading time from "blazingly fast" to "kinda sluggish". Add a bit more and the bounce rate will sharply increase.

You should try to fill the initial viewport as quickly as possible. It's okay if some images aren't done yet, but after 1 second one should be able to start reading. The layout should be stable (no jumping) and all the text should be there.
huh, why the goatse logo?
What do you mean by finding enough content? From what I've seen in advice threads here, just make up projects to fill out your portfolio.

I'm fairly new to this as well. To get my first job I had a portfolio with almost 100% made up stuff. Only 2 projects were actually for clients, and one of them was unpaid, for a family friend. 

I included a few pens from Codepen, and this worked out pretty nicely. I was hired by a man who is not a web dev or programmer and wouldn't know what he was looking at if I'd given him my Github. But link him to a couple of "cool" things on Codepen where he can see the live demo and code side by side and it's all oohs and ahhs, wow you must be so smart to be able to do that. I don't know if someone with a development/programming background would want to see Codepen stuff at all - I'm interested to hear others' thoughts. But the stuff I had on Codepen wasn't very impressive at all in my opinion, just very trendy and showy. It worked, though.

Went to a meetup and somehow we began talking about codecademy. Guy said "DON'T mention codecademy on your resume. I learned that the hard way." This is simply anecdotal but I have a feeling that codecademy is so "low level" that it really isn't impressive to an employer. Sorry if I'm offending codecademy users by calling it low level, I don't know. I've only used codecademy on occasion and there's probably a lot that I don't know about it. The people at the meetup seemed to think it was very low level.

I think if you can volunteer your time to open source contributions, this is a big deal. Contributing to open source projects does many things, it helps out, it connects you with other people, and it gives you something to add to your resume or portfolio that is a "real" project, when you don't have a lot of clients or history to show yet. That's what I'm doing right now and I hope it will open doors for me. I've already met some awesome people and have been hooked up with some freelance side work to do - extra cash rocks. I've also been connected to a lot of learning resources that I didn't even know existed.

Yeah, like I said I'm sort of new to web dev as well but I hope I helped you anyway. Good luck!!
Thanks this is exactly the type of info i was looking for.
Codecademy is very low-level. 
ok, but in what scenario would i want to use this?

on desktop my monitor is plenty wide enough to display the nav at all times, on my phone i don't have a mouse to hover with...
Looks great, nice and smooth.  However, I'm not a big fan of hover features because how do you get them to work on a touchscreen?
I guess it gives that clean feel. Uncluttered, at least. 
> On bigger devices, we use Modernizr to detect touch and no-touch devices (using.touch and .no-touch classes).
> On touch devices, the lateral navigation items (labels and icons) are visible by default, while on no-touch devices they are shown when the user hovers over the lateral navigation.
Along with /u/littlewebthingies, on touch devices it will show as a little expandable menu in the bottom right.
Ahh I missed that. My bad then
Look at ITCSS. I couples pretty well with BEM and BEM-like styles. 
ITCSS is pretty cool and simple to understand. I would say combine all you know about each methodology and use the ideas that make sense according to your project. Since they are methodologies, they don't have any hard set rules.  
>Why can't they have Chrome etc installed also and use that for everything but the legacy apps?

Many companies don't allow users to install anything. No admin rights what so ever, so when the machine was originally imaged... it stays that way until the machine dies or you get updated by "desktop support".
Most companies do, but that doesn't mean you can stop supporting your legacy custom applications...
Some companies require everyone to use Internet Explorer and not download anything from the internet. (I worked at one such company). Additionally, there are plenty of non-tech savvy people on old computers who don't really care about what browser they're using, they just click the one they know goes to the internet. 
We have chrome and IE at work as well. It is a pain for the users to have to switch browsers to make things work, but most people learn which one to use then they move on. One day I will get to say bye bye to IE.
What I don't understand is what are these devs programming that can only work in IE? Is it strictly visual bugs (css) or is it functionality (javascript)? I often hear about apps only working in IE8 - but when IE8 came out (2009) it was long considered bad practice to make sites work in one browser.
Sigh. It's like the Y2k of browsers, we need some popular business critical website to drop legacy IE support so IT will be forced to add a modern browser to their image.
I'm talking more about supporting legacy IE for a general user base. For example one of our site's analytics shows 3.5% of the sessions come from IE 7 and IE 8. So then there's the decision of how much money to spend on supporting IE 7-8. They might need IE 8 for their custom app, but our site certainly doesn't want or need it.
With the end of support of older IE many of the general public users will be pushed toward upgrading, but I think they are statistically insignificant compared to corporate users locked into a browser. The general public will have to go out of their way to not upgrade, and if they choose that then it's on them.

But for the companies that lock out the use of other browsers, are we enabling them in restricting that by trying to support legacy browsers in general?
There were some old technologies like ActiveX components that were IE specific and dropped after 8. Devs took advantage of the cool or complex things you could do with them not knowing the technology wasn't going to make it in the long run.
My company tried this. 

Over the next week there were 80+ support calls (in a company of <500 people) that were due to people trying to log into a web app with Chrome. After it didn't slow down the next week, we added a custom error to all the apps saying "This app requires Internet Explorer and is not compatible with $yourBrowser. Please open the application with Internet Explorer".

It didn't help, and 3 weeks after the initial rollout, we were all back to IE9 (though, we've since upgraded to IE10 <_<). January 12th cannot come fast enough.
There's definitely a lot more to consider beyond a simple traffic statistic, but I get what you mean.
Ouch. I suspected that might be a problem when running multiple browsers, sad to see it confirmed.
Yeah, it's not so much a technical problem as a workflow problem. If there were a reason we needed Chrome for our users I'm sure we would have sucked it up. But when it's unnecessary and problematic, it's hard to justify.

If it makes you feel any better, our IT department left us the ability to install Chrome via the web installer, working under the (pretty much correct) assumption that if you were smart enough to get it installed, you could be trusted to read and comprehend the error messages.
A little bit of padding and less uppercase would go a long way with this site.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging
nvrmnd you got it :-)
if you know the folder name and the file in it you want to edit then you could utilize the fuzzy search in goto anywhere.  
if you have so many folders that you cant remember the name then i don't know a solution.
Does it have an option to emulate touches instead of clicks like chrome does?
You've been able to do this in chrome for years.
How's that any better than what Firefox and Chrome have to offer?

I also don't like that it's all about iPhones and iPads. Pretty obnoxious, really.
Is this really how Apple people view website responsive design?  What size iPhone / iPad you're on?

This is a joke, right?
If all you're designing for is iStuff, I suppose... :/ 
No, no it's not. Chrome developer tools are way more powerful than that. 
What have you been using until now ? This has been available in other browsers for a long time....
Except anyone who is only developing for apple devices is a moron. Firefox developer edition and chrome have superior implementations of this. 
It's basically the same as the new device mode in the current canary and future chrome builds plus the icons.
It had better be. Have you ever had to attach your ios device to a local safari window to get a goddamned console? Rage inducing
Firefox/Chrome have presets like this, but I've never seen the point. I usually manually scale down until something looks wrong, fix it, then keep going down to about 320px wide, which is my cutoff for responsive.
Safari has finally started to take itself more seriously than just a consumer browser... Also I believe they're the only to support background blend modes atm
I had no idea about any of this, super helpful. Thanks for posting.
Another tool for the toolbox, I guess. I would use a mix for testing, I don't know if I would develop with this. Pretty attached to Chrome.
Is that just changing the User Agent?
It's a nice idea, but the devil is still in the details. Every browser and device has its own rendering quirks, CSS/HTML bugs etc. that aren't visible unless you're testing on the real thing (or an ios/android device emulator). 
And as usual, every other brand and products doesn't exist. Chrome has iPad alongside with Samsung Galaxy S4 and Amazon Kindle and it has been that way for years. That means "yeah, we care about all developers."

Stop saying it's awesome when Apple implement a feature that has existed for years and is better. It is not.

I Apple created cars, it would only accept iOil which is like regular oil but more expensive.
I am so sick of Safari. The past 2 weeks all I have at to deal with is random bugs, poor implementations of standards, random memory leaks, and memory buffer failures on Safari.

Don't even get me started on the Dev tools. What a piece of shit. The CSS editor acts like a Word document, where it will auto-complete all the wrong things and accept incorrect input. The Timelines profile is the worst of the three major browsers, not allowing JS flame charts, and not even showing memory allocation. The biggest issue, the one that keeps me up at night: when the target browser tab closes, the corresponding dev tool window shuts down. Who does that anymore?! That makes it (neigh) impossible to debug sites that cause a memory leak and crash the browser or tab. Also, want to debug iOS? Better have a Mac. 

Apple's behavior is shameful when it comes to Safari development. All the other browser makers are pushing the web forward, Safari is holding it back. [Safari is the new IE](http://nolanlawson.com/2015/06/30/safari-is-the-new-ie/)
If you're on a Mac and have XCode installed, open up the iOS simulator, it's even better.

Or attach a real iPhone / iPad and debug through Safari: http://appletoolbox.com/2014/05/use-web-inspector-debug-mobile-safari/
Awesome!! I've been waiting for safari to implement something like this. Thanks for sharing!
[appropriate](http://static.thegeekdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/apple1.jpg)
Yea we used to do a lot of device testing but found if you're doing proper responsive design its not worth  the time and money
Okay, I know Chrome has had this for about a year now, but I just went into Safari to test it out and I'm actually pretty impressed with the developer tools they have now. They seem to have improved a lot since I switched to Chrome and Firefox. 
It's awful, you don't have enough space thanks to the intrusive huge device selection bar.
I'm not knocking it as a browser, but its not available for every platform, it doesn't matter how good it is. Browsers should be cross compatible, I shouldn't have to buy apple products to test web apps I build. Safari should be cross platform or it shouldn't exist, just like edge/ie should be cross platform or they shouldn't exist.
It's funny watching everyone bash on Apple. I wish the chrome dev tools were as pretty as this. 
Came here to see all the hater posts. Was not disappointed.
It is **Safari Responsive Design Mode** not *Any Browser Responsive Design Mode* and it is the only honest implementation available, since it shows you almost exactly how the page will render in the various incarnations of Safari, since in any uptodate apple device you will have the same version of Safari. Other implementations (Firefox, Chrome) are just a joke in this regard, since they pretend to show you how the page will render on any device, failing miserably.
I didn't know Chrome could do this, that's freaking awesome.
[deleted]
As well as the developer edition of Firefox if I'm not mistaken. 
Opera did it first. Maybe even before the rise of Chrome.


How? May you elucidate this for me?
My favorite feature is the one where you can do boundary testing on responsive design - visually shows you all the min/max breakpoints used and allows you to click to resize to that pixel width/height. 
Oh wow, I had no idea! I've been using Screenfly this whole time! This changes everything!
I was using Chrome just yesterday and had trouble getting it to work. Setting it to different devices wouldn't change the actual size of the viewport even after refreshing. 
Correct, Firefox has a [Responsive Design View](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Tools/Responsive_Design_View) as well, but on both those browsers the usage is a bit kludgy (in my humble opinion). 
1 year. 

Edit: Downvote all you want but Chrome's device mode landed *on Canary* at the end of July 2014. http://www.girliemac.com/blog/2014/07/28/devicemode/
It is AWFUL in chrome. Does not actually translate.
Okay, but what's cool about the new Safari one is your ability to choose which browser you want to emulate and you can even toggle the screen pixel density to be 1x, 2x, or 3x (for imgs you're loading for Retina or 1080p). I don't think Chrome has those features. http://imgur.com/a/W8UJg
Seems like it's not better, but nice for Apple devs. It is sort of nice.

Edit: pretty -> nice to make it a haiku
It isn't obnoxious for them to make it "all about" basically the only devices which run Safari.
I'd presume so you can test in safari, which a lot of folks will be using on the apple devices.

I don't think having the option is particularly obnoxious.  That said, I'm sticking with Chrome.
It's prettier!
It's handy actually - It's all about iDevices because it will spoof the UA, OS, browser & device-orientation. 

It's as closer to iOS safari rendering as you'll get in a browser.  It's not better - it's different.
This is how most of any company I'm at views responsive.  They only talk in Apple device dimensions. 

One day they will learn responsive is not defined by or related to Apple devices, or any specific device for that matter.
Apple made other browsers? /s
I have to be honest I can't agree with you completely. In general of course you are right, but last 3 freelance projects that I had have next in common: "That's our internal app, we supply our employers only with iPads, we don't care if it won't work on everything else". So yeah, I'm 90% agree with you, but you can't deny that there is customers who will care only about specific brand or specific device.
Who said anything about only developing for apple? Anyone who uses Firefox or Chrome and expects the results to be an accurate depiction of Safari's rendering is naive. 

Well rounded testing involves numerous devices and resolutions and targets the most common browsers and form factors (mobile safari probably being one of them).
New? This has been in Chrome for a long time now, with more features than Safari's. And it's been in stable for a long time, not canary.
well it's apple, do something the competition does for a while now, put some shiny icons (but only of your brand!) on it and they will LOVE it
I hadn't seen this yet. It looks a lot nicer than the current chrome implementation.
You should be doing the opposite. Scaling from mobile size takes out half of the work trying to make things fit instead of just making them look better.
You can resize any of the presets.
Also wanted to agree that Firefox and Chrome have been superior all along
Chrome has had this same feature for a very long time in its development tools. Click the little mobile icon in the top left to view the options. It's more configurable than what is shown here.
Way longer than a year. At least two years.
Cross platform apps always have an inherent performance constraint.  That constraint shouldn't decrease the performance and experience of every person that uses apps because you have a simplistic ideology.
Nope, this isn't less or more accurate than any other browser.  It is still desktop safari with a resizable viewport and some ux string modification.
If you want real emulation you have to use xcode with the ios emulator or use remote debugging. 
It defaults to touches instead of clicks if it's a touch device. 
https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/iterate/device-mode/?hl=en  upper left icon in dev tools that looks like a phone(ish) 

Warning: This does not emulate the device selected, it emulates a touch device constrained to the screen size of the device selected. 
Yea chrome can do  remote debugging too but that wasn't the question
Literally any edition of firefox. Ctrl+ Shift + M
And Opera. 
Yepp, long before.

2002-11-13 - Opera 7.0 Beta 1:

> Press Shift+F11 to enable small-screen mode, which emulates a hand-held (small-screen) device running Opera

http://www.opera.com/docs/changelogs/windows/700b1/

Opera 8 also added "fit to width", which made is easier to use. The MDI (multi document interface) also meant you could have multiple instances of the same page visible in different sizes at the same time and with the automatic update feature you could have them all refresh automatically every 10 seconds.  
  
Start a new MDI parent on monitor #2, start 2-3 different instances, resize them, activate automatic update, and you could code and see your changes in "real time" in different size by just moving your vision to monitor #2.  
  
I miss Opera.  
  
EDIT: Fun fact: This was 2 months after the first version of Firefox was launched.
Opera did everything first. ..and better.
ctrl+shift+j (win), cmd+opt+i (mac) to open your console...  

At the top left there is a mobile phone icon. Click it. Return to the window with the page you're inspecting (I have my console broken off of the main window so it doesn't screw with the window size) and you'll see a ton of awesome stuff in the top toolbar. 
http://i.imgur.com/LHohqV1.png
Better to hear it in 2016 than 2017.
This guy just made your day. 

Damn that sucks, I just tried it on chrome version`47.0.2526.106`and it worked great. Throttling and configurable pixel density are also nice to have.
You may need to add a tag in your HTML to adjust the viewport settings.
Firefox and Chrome can simulate PC, iPhone, iPad and Android screens, spoof user agent, do bandwidth throttling.

It seems like Safari can only emulate Apple devices.
Not sure what you mean by Kludgy here. It does the same thing but you pick from a drop down instead of a list of pictures. It also allows you to emulate apple products and non-apple products, which is probably more useful.
wtf is kludgy
It feels clunky, but it works.

The good news: the new implementation found in the Chrome Canary Channel is simply fantastic. I hope it makes its way to stable soon.

Uhhhh, about that. They've been in Chrome for a long time. x:

This has one too many syllables to be a hai ku. If only you had written "nice" instead of "pretty".
It'll save you from having to open the simulator 90% of the time, especially since desktop safari and mobile safari are pretty close to one another in terms of capabilities and rendering at this point. You'll ultimately still need to open up the simulator or pull out a testing device for real QA work though.
but if you are designing general purpose websites and want to see how it will look in something that is not safari specific....
How is that.  Different from chrome? You can do all those things and could for years.
Android is selling 5 phones per iPhone and (counting amazon) something like 12 tablets per iPad.  I think windows phone sold almost 3 dozen phones in 2015 as well.  Safari has almost no market share compared to Chrome + Firefox + IE.

Perhaps the companies you're working at should do a little market research.  As the web developer, you should open their eyes.
It's the same way where I work. I developed a scaling CSS framework for my company but they ended up going with Foundation because instead of asking the creator of something they would rather ask a thousand users. . .

I'm gonna take this moment to plug my CSS framework that has ONE breakpoint (800px) and fits every device on the planet: www.basicss.com


Yeah, you always have to match the client's requirements, but I'd still be cursing under my breath for a request like this even for an internal application. My thought / suggestion would be "you're on apple products now, but what if that changes 3 years down the line, do you want to have to call me back in? It's better to plan for the long term instead of developing for the short term."
He's referring to the picture, where every device represented is an Apple product. 
Look at the picture again, the resolution options are all apple products, plus a couple common resolutions. I'm not saying don't use safari, I'm saying since safari runs on multiple platforms, I'd rather not see preset screen sizes. I'm not criticizing people that use safari for testing, I'm criticizing apple for making a testing tool that assumes they are the only tech company in existence. 
There is a different version of it in canary though which looks more like the Safari tool.
Google recently hired a designer for the sole purpose of prettifying and improving the user experience of the dev tools in chrome. the result of that can be seen in the current canary build. those new tools look quite similar to the safari dev mode.t he new design will land at some point in chrome as well.
heres a video about it: https://youtu.be/dJR-n8szgBc?t=12m54s

Visually maybe, chrome's implementation is more complete.
Dumb question perhaps, but when given a PSD mockup of a site, is the mobile and the desktop view given or just one or the other? 

If not, then who makes the decisions regarding responsiveness? Decisions like when the menu collapses, or where elements go when the screen enlarges. 

Maybe this question only applies on teams large enough to separate responsibilities to that level. I don't know, I've only ever worked on a small team where I do a little of everything.
Yes, I love Chrome's mobile view features. Safari seems far too limiting, although I could see myself possibly using it for testing in the future. 
You're right the whole tech industry would be way better off if everyone had their own proprietary solution for everything. Let's make everything more complicated. Silly me. 
Never said that is it like testing on the real thing, but it is **way** more accurate than testing how it looks on an iPhone, iPad, or Safari window on a different screen using Chrome's or Firefox's responsive mode, since it shares the same WebKit engine, and eventually the same version of the same engine.
Where have you been all my life?
I do have it installed...haven't opened it for months. Remember when it was my go to browser :/
You miss opera? Why? It still works... I use it.
not css transition ;)
A note to that:

If you use the developer/canary version of chrome (Chrome v.~49 I think?) the screen size can be adjusted with by simply opening the dev-tools; you will then have a light-grey bar on top of the site with the resolution settings.

EDIT: worded better
idiot dumbass here, like what? I've also seen this happen on Chrome
Sure, but why bother cluttering the interface with non-Apple devices when nobody uses them?  ^/s
Firefox does not spoof the useragent without an additional extension. At least not for me and I'm using FirefoxDeveloperEdition
Safari does all that except from throttling, which can be achieved OS-wide.
> Not sure what you mean by Kludgy here.

It isn't designed by the Apple gods.
Apple's responsive design view is just better in intangible and undescribe-able ways. /s

Damn, that's awesome. Been using it for so long and didn't even realize that was what those numbers meant! If only it had a browser emulator, too. 
Im confused? Where can you change which browser you're emulating? Or the pixel density?It looks like you can only emulate devices, not browsers and pixel density. I've been using the Chrome emulator since it came out. 
I fixed it, although "better" being on two lines makes it a quirky haiku
This is Apple. Apparently no competitor devices exist.
Then develop it in something other than Safari; that isn't what Safari is for.
Because it uses webkit which is more representative of iOS's rendering than Chromes blink. It's as good or better than chrome for testing your design on iOS devices. It's an extra tool in the bag, I don't get all the hate and chrome circlejerk.
>  I think windows phone sold almost 3 dozen phones in 2015

That's being unfair, it was likely twice that number.
My latest client's user base is 50+ affluents. Their mobile analytics are 95% iPad and iPhone. A few percent is Blackberry. Zero growth on Android.

Sales is just one dimension of market research.
More in the millions for WP :) And outside the US, it's much more popular, often overtaking iOS.
> I think windows phone sold almost 3 dozen phones in 2015 as well.

I can't tell if you're saying that there were 3 dozen models of windows phones sold, or if you're making a joke about there being 36 people out there who've actually purchased a windows phone.
Please explain testing across the multitude of default browsers + chrome, OS versions, and screen size options in the Android world.
Actually you need to do a little market research. Safari makes up the majority of browser usage in the US, UK, and France.

Didn't realize that, but still, why would you ever use Safari to test any other non-Apple product? 
> I'm saying since safari runs on multiple platforms

Not anymore
What's the canary version missing?  There's less devices to choose from but the majority of those on Chrome I've never used.

And all other functionality that I use is now bundled away elsewhere leaving a more minimal view.  I much prefer it.

Unless I'm missing something...
You would expect to get designs for all targeted break points (some projects I've worked on have had 5 breakpoints for instance). If you don't, then you can either ask for them, or do it yourselves - it'll depend upon what is agreed upon initially.
Where I work it depends on the site. If the budget is lower, I'll only get a mockup for the desktop site and then I'll just decide how to make it respond on my own (I'll often consult the designer to see what they think). For larger projects, I'll usually get a desktop and mobile mockup. Even then I often will make tweaks and work with the designer to figure out even better ways to make the site respond.
Why can't we just have both?

    Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
Though they may be similar, I don't think they'll ever be the same versions used in both. 

While I agree it is likely to give a more accurate representation of how things may look on mobile Safari, I think you're practically just as likely to be fine using Chrome for the same thing, since you'll have to test and will likely find bugs on mobile Safari whichever you choose - because there will be differences anyway.

On top of that, I'm not sure Safari offers touch emulation at the moment, I may be wrong, but that is far more valuable than a slightly similar rendering viewport.
Under your bed, pumpkin
It's the only browser I can actually use anymore. Chrome is slow as hell, Chrome Canary keeps crashing randomly, Firefox is also slow as hell. :(
I hope you mean Opera 12, as >12 isn't Opera anymore, it's Chromium. Old Opera is 100% dead. 
  
Yeah, O12 works, but it's getting slow, RES doesn't work and my button for "open in Firefox" is used more and more in order to get pages working.
i know i was just kidding ;) to be super fair, ajax was done by IE first.
Using canary, can confirm.
It sounds like you're talking about the same thing I am, but I'm telling him how to turn that bar on and off from the console switch.

I could be wrong; I don't have Canary.
I'm just using the normal release cycle of chrome and have had that option for ages, very useful. Unless you're talking about something different. http://i.imgur.com/VoprMvp.png
Chrome gives many more defaults, the ability to simulate any screen size and pixel density, network throttling, and a handful of other emulator tools.
Because some web devs use Safari as their main browser.

[edit]: don't ask :-)
[Not for long](https://hg.mozilla.org/integration/fx-team/rev/f28fd9bd845c)

[Edit] I can't wait to see what user agents will be featured, Firefox-OS lock-in maybe ? :-)
Indeed Safari has a user agent menu with some PC profiles.

It's too bad the default list of devices only features Apple Devices in the Mobile/Tablet section




Safari doesn't emulate any browser. It just changes the UA which you can also do with chrome.
It emulates the resolution, pixel density and the user-agent string that it sends to the site.

It can't perfectly render an iOS device since it's a different engine after all but for things like size and pixel density it does it just fine.
that's a pretty terrible response.
It's not hate it's just that the sentiment is more "oh that's nice Apple finally did that standard feature" vs the op sentiment of "wow amazing!"

We aren't hating it. We just aren't impressed.
The later I'd say
The later
ACTUAL responsive design is generally tested at multiple width breakpoints.  "How does this render at 320 / 360 / 768 / 800 / whatever is desired width?" and not NOT "How does this render on an iPhone 4 in landscape".

There are a couple of graphics to help you visualize how the breakpoints work out here: https://material.angularjs.org/latest/layout/introduction
chrome dev tools lets you test as basically any screen size, pixel density, and user agent. with a ton of presets for common devices including iphones, galaxies, windows phones, touch laptops, and tablets. 
You can change the width with the bars on the side, and can set them to be permanent & named. It is very easy to customize the size of them, what is shown in the image is simply the default.
As interesting as your AppleInsider link from July 2014 is, you'll find that a lot has changed recently, but it still really varies based on your market.

[StatCounter](http://gs.statcounter.com/#mobile_browser-ww-monthly-200812-201512) has Mobile Chrome at double Mobile Safari.

[Statista](http://www.statista.com/statistics/263517/market-share-held-by-mobile-internet-browsers-worldwide-since-2009/) is similar.

[w3schools](http://www.w3schools.com/browsers/browsers_mobile.asp) has Android at about 3x vs iOS.

I don't doubt that some very niche combos could net you more iOS visitors than Android, but Android is where the sales are.




Exactly!

Either way, it's really hard to get a reliable representation of what is happening [on an iThing] if you aren't using the emulator in XCode or have an actual device on hand. Same goes for Windows phones, too... 

For example, the testing team that I work with uses Device Anywhere, and that EMULATES the rotation of the device... which causes all kinds of weirdness.
Huh, isn't that some bullshit, its been a long time since I've had safari installed on anything, it shouldn't exist at all then. 
Devices that you've used aren't important, devices that users use are.

Safari appears to be missing network throttling, a more exhaustive device list, more information, and I may be mistaken, but touch emulation too.
Chrome has actually done a great job catching some quirks that pop up on mobile safari that I hadn't seen yet. Things like vh that just completely broke the version on my iPhone 4 were replicated exactly.
Hello Freddy...
Ohhh, oops. RES works for me, I don't know why it doesn't for you.

All my browsers have issues except Opera, so far, but Opera is actually slowing down a bit for me now.
I just realized that I worded my reply bad.

We are not talking about the same, in Chrome v.49 the bar is always there (without pressing the phone icon) and looks light-grey instead of black-grey. 
I mean what tags is it looking for
Entry MBP? My condolences.
I use Opera as my main dev environment myself. edit: /s
It's true... I can see one from my desk. 
it gives me, on average, an hour more of battery life and I don't have to listen to the fan every time I want to watch a youtube video so yeah I'm with you. Though I use chrome for development because I work mostly with Angular and batarang is amazing
You're correct. My bad :) 
Wow well thanks for the well thought out explanation of why. You know, it's really easy to dismiss things when you aren't trying to justify yourself at all.
Yeah, I remember reading about responsive design being about the design itself, the natural breakpoints, and not the devices (because the devices change every couple years).
Okay, now how does your QA team handle that?
It even lets you simulate a throttled internet connection so you can see what it's like to load your site on 4g
Sure, but that's not the actual device.  Devices tend to work differently than they do inside Chrome Dev Tools.
Safari does too. You just can't tell from this screenshot.
Those are global statistics. I would assume the websites most people on the sub work on are targeted at English speaking countries, mainly the US and UK.

You might also be interested to know that in the US iPhones hold about a 45% market share. 
I wasn't suggesting that the list should be reduced to the few devices I personally own.  My point was that Chrome provides you with a static list of about 20 devices, a number which I do not utilise, like the Blackberry Playbook, LG Optimus etc.  Canary comes with fewer devices in the drop down by default with the ability to edit and add your own custom devices.  This to me is a much better solution.  I get to have profiles for all the devices I wish to test on, and only the ones I test on.

And I was still referring to Canary and not Safari when I said all other functionality appears to be moved elsewhere leaving a less cluttered space.

So I'm sill curious as to why Chromes implementation is more complete than the Canary version?
Yeah, I could see Chrome being good at emulating the gaps in good behavior between Safari and Chrome just by "turning off" the various improvements that Chrome has over base WebKit, but it's harder to catch the extra stupidity that Safari adds, like fake hover states or broken ECMAscript implementations.
Opera 12?
Oh! I must acquire this build... is it only there when the console is open or like always?
There are some meta tags in the head
I think there is a meta viewport tag.
So you're the one??!!
Any specific reason on why you choose to use Opera as your dev environment?
Having software that is only designed to work for 16% of the mobile market and a statistically insignificant part of the desktop market is really dumb. At least chrome realizes that people use devices other than android and browsers other than chrome and builds their browser to help test in those environments, so it's less work for the developer

They use Chrome/Firefox's ability to set breakpoints based on devices or arbitrary resolutions they want to plug in. They sometimes spot check with whatever device they own.
> So I'm sill curious as to why Chromes implementation is more complete than the Canary version?

Looks like I got a bit muddled up there with Canary and Safari :)
It's the latest one, I don't read versions.
It is only shown while the dev-tools are open.
Because of its great palm pilot support. /s
It is not dumb to market a product to a subsection of the total potential user base. Apple are fairly specialised, and have for a long time catered pretty much exclusively to Apple users. This "really dumb" way of doing things has worked out for them because it allows them to cater better to that group. If it was easy to make a browser with all of the capabilities of Chrome without any drawbacks then don't you think that more people would have done it? Yes it could be done with Safari with Apple's backing, but would it be worth the extra work just to make a small group of people more happy? Very few non-Apple users would start using Safari just because they added some extra development tools.

Apple doesn't *want* people using their hardware to develop for non-Apple products anyway, because how do they benefit from that? Apple keeps things insular, and in return they get a lot of dedicated customers in exchange for isolating many people who probably wouldn't have ever bought Apple anyway. They don't try to beat the likes of Google or Microsoft at their own game, they develop something similar but ultimately quite different, for different types of people.


I guess your QA team is more lax than ours.  We device test now.
I don't think you're the only one. I'm assuming most the down votes  I'm getting are from those thinking I'm talking about Safari.

So to be clear, it looks like:

Safaris implementation < Chromes implementation < Canaries implementation

Looking forward to those changes making there way into Chrome.
Then you're not using the "good" Opera, but Chromium with a bit less features. I have little interest in using that version when I can just as well use Chromium. (As I do)
you are obviously an apple fanboy and aren't open to differing opinions, so I'll stop discussing this with you, but I just have to say that this:

> Apple doesn't want people using their hardware to develop for non-Apple products anyway

Is one of the stupidest things I've heard. This is the "webdev" subreddit, not the "applewebdev" subreddit. If you are building websites you shouldn't give a shit about what platform you are building it on, you should care about attracting all the possible users to your website from all the possible devices.
Looks like balance has been restored at least :)

Agreed, I've always been impressed with Chromes dev tools every iteration. It's nice to hear it's still moving forward in a positive direction too.
I use Opera because nothing else works ðŸ™‚ðŸ‘Œ
Lol I am the opposite of an Apple fanboy; I'm a complete Microsoft whore, but I see where Apple belongs in the market. Not that being a fanboy would be a reason to dismiss otherwise valid points anyway. You were just avoiding having to give an actual response to them.

Safari isn't made for web developers. It's made for casual users who typically aren't too capable with computers. That's Apple's whole thing. It's worked well for them so why should they change it? To satisfy some people on some forum who aren't using their products anyway?
> Safari isn't made for web developers. It's made for casual users who typically aren't too capable with computers. 

Which is why Apple built in those developer tools right? So the casual - non-developer - user can use them. Brilliant logic!

> That's Apple's whole thing

Makes total sense, that's why they built their OS on FreeBSD, for the casual users.

>To satisfy some people on some forum who aren't using their products anyway?

Man, you keep on making dumb statement after dumb statement. Mac products are all over the development world.
Apple built the developer tools because lots of people developing *for iOS* use Apple products to do so.

Are you flat out denying that Apple cater to more casual users? Now who's the fanboy? ;)

Mac products are pretty abundant, but again, primarily for development for Apple devices. But not always! But typically in those cases the development isn't done in Safari, and that wouldn't be changed by allowing users to simulate more different browsing experiences.

You just have unrealistic expectations of how businesses should develop their software. You can't cater to everybody, and Apple don't even pretend to try to.
> Apple built the developer tools because lots of people developing for iOS use Apple products to do so.

Apple is not dumb. They know that people use their products for doing development besides iOS. That's why they've included java, php, ruby and other development tools on the systems for years and years.

> Are you flat out denying that Apple cater to more casual users? Now who's the fanboy? ;)

I'm a developer who works on a macbook pro in an agency full of designers who work on intel pros. I have a windows machine at home (and my parents have 2 windows machines). I am very familiar with both environments and I'll tell you, Apple does not cater any more to casuals than MS. 

> You just have unrealistic expectations of how businesses should develop their software

I guess by unrealistic, you mean Chrome? Also, Apple is the richest corporation in the world, so they can't do as good a job as google?
Lol I don't think that we're going to agree on this, and you're now taking it personally enough to start downvoting me, so I'm going to stop now.
fyi, while I agree that we aren't going to agree, I'm not downvoting you
It also can make use of WebGL (like Pixi.js) which makes it pretty fast.
It'd be nice if Dart was included in the title.
Flash and Dart? Don't think this will catch on any time soon...
While I'm not a video, I'm kind of bored so I typed up quick overview of what the different properties are.

Position:

* `static` is the default `position` for all elements. Elements are positioned where they belong in the document.
* `relative` is just like `static` in regard to being positioned in the regular content flow, but it also has access to the `top`, `right`, `bottom`, `left` and `z-index` properties.
* `absolute` removes the element from the content flow and places the element relative to the nearest non-`static` (typically `relative`) element instead at the top left corner, expanding based on its contents. To change the positioning of the `absolute` element, set the respective top/right/left/bottom values.
* `fixed` is just like `absolute`, but is relative to the screen (or its nearest computed layer created with `transform`).

As for `float`, you know how `display: block` makes an element fill all available horizontal space? That's why paragraphs, divs, headers etc. create new "rows". Float changes that so that `block` elements only take up the space required by its content, allowing other elements to use the space next to it. As for the values of `float`; `left` aligns the block to the left, and `right` align it to the right. 

An important note for `float` is that you must always *clear* floats, else their parents won't consider their height, probably causing layout issues in your document. You clear floats either by setting `overflow: hidden` to the parent element, or to an element with `clear: both` (or `left` or `right`) *after* the floated elements. Typically this is done with a `::after` psuedo element.
If you prefer to learn by watching videos:

* [CSS Floats](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFGBNv2KeVU)
* [CSS Positioning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kejG8G0dr5U&list=PLqGj3iMvMa4L731ispRfGAabXeRpM4RL6)
Here's a good link for positioning: http://alistapart.com/article/css-positioning-101
and this is useful for understanding float: https://css-tricks.com/all-about-floats/
css-tricks.com has good overviews of this kind of stuff. 

You also might want to look into Flexbox while you're at it:
https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/

I find the best way to learn CSS positioning is to just make a sample HTML doc and play around with it. Make an arbitrary layout sketch and try to replicate it with different positioning techniques. There are several ways to do any one layout. But they all start with the "display" property, so read up on that in detail first. 
> As for float, you know how display: block makes an element fill all available horizontal space? That's why paragraphs, divs, headers etc. create new "rows". Float changes that so that block elements only take up the space required by its content, allowing other elements to use the space next to it.

I'm still a bit of newb myself - but what you are describing sounds to me like inline i.e. where the element only takes up the space required by it's content. Whereas, floated elements are always displayed as blocks?
thanks!
An element with `display: inline-block` and an element with `float: left` are very similar and occasionally interchangeable. Floated elements aren't *displayed* as blocks, but they get some block-like properties. Although in general you should only float elements with `display` set to `block`.

`inline` is just for elements that essentially behave like text, like the bold or emphasize tags. You should mostly never have to set something to `inline`. In fact a far too common mistake even among professionals is not setting another `display` value on elements with `inline` as default when they should.
floated elements are block elements by specification but without a set width they shrink to the size of their content ("shrinkfit").
What exactly are these rankings.. ranking on?
I'm working on switching my sites.    I feel bad having work out there without SSL.  Now that it's free to do, I have no excuses.  * sigh * I'll do it tonight.
AFAIK they are rating the port 443 using SSLLabs.com but not other tools like https://securityheaders.io and also only for websites that redirect to the secure version. The ranking is the Top 1000 sites according to Alexa.
Definitely a must do!
I would strongly recommend you do this with Canvas and requestAnimationFrame. I was in the same boat.

I tried to animate a motion path with SVG and performance was subpar on iOS. Once I converted my animation to Canvas, it easily hit 60 fps. 
I know this doesn't help your situation, but Chrome/Chromium has some serious bugs with SVG and animation. For instance, I had an animated gif in an `<image>` element, I stretched it to fit the container using `preserveAspectRatio="xMidYMid slice"`, and the result just blinked uncontrollably. 
feGuassianBlur shouldn't be too hard to duplicate in Canvas, but how to replicate the feComponentTransfer fluid effect?

Edit: I guess I could use getImageData() after blurring the image, run a threshold deterministic operation, and inject that data back into the picture. That would work.
Perhaps only applying the filter [as was done here](http://codepen.io/Gthibaud/pen/vNZQzB) is a solution to that? Letting Canvas manage the particles and some inline SVG apply the filters? Seems to work well on Chrome. 

In your case it would probably be something like the following:


    canvas {
      display: block;
      width: 100%;
      height: 100%;
      -webkit-filter: url('#firey');
      filter: url('#firey');
    }

It seems to work great here on Chrome. Bonus with this technique is that you can add *a lot* more particles. :-)

[Here's a start I made](https://jsfiddle.net/imjasonmiller/x559o994/) based on your version.
Awesome! Now how is it that SVG filters work so fast on a canvas static image but not on several images composited together? Compositing images isn't computationally heavy, and filtering images isn't computationally heavy, so why is it the browsers down know how to do them in that order automatically? :P

Well thanks. That is an excellent start!
Great to hear! I think that happened because it was manipulating the DOM tree quite a lot. Manipulating the DOM tends to unfortunately be a very slow process. Surprised me as well to see a filter applied to a Canvas bypassed all of it. I learned about some new quirk too. :-)
I have always worked for agencies but at my last job we worked very closely with allot of start ups. I liked the culture of startups but the whole not really knowing if your job would exist in a few months thing would probably get to me a bit. 

I like working for agencies but I will say I have been yearning to work for more of a product company than a service company. I think I would like working on a big customer facing platform more than a bunch of small business facing stuff / digital advertising stuff
I don't work for any of those companies, but I do work for a digital agency as a developer. I have no experience with startups, but just personally, I think agency life generally works with my personality well. I like jumping from project to project and checking out new technologies. Granted, I rarely get to dig as deep into a project as I would like due to budget or timeline constraints, but I like it for now.

The one thing about agency life that I think is important to know is that you HAVE to enjoy people, and you need to be able to switch between different projects and clients very quickly. If you get really annoyed when people interrupt you, agency life will get really tiring really quickly. In addition, agency life can (note: CAN) be a much better work-life balance. Well-run agencies won't have you working overtime all the time (mine doesn't), but I think, in general, all startups expect you to hustle for them as much as they need to ship the next product/version.
I guess I'm in a unique position in that I'm working for a start-up that is being funded by it's parent company which is a digital agency, so I've had the chance to work for both.

Personally I prefer the start up side of things. You get to create this one product in a tiny team and watch it grow. Also, with it being such a small team, we all get experience in every aspect of making a product to ship: design, ux, actual back end stuff, server design and setup, content, pretty much everything.

Saying that, I really enjoyed tackling a different problem every week at the DA. It just wasn't as fun as creating something from the ground up.

They're both a lot of fun, but I can see how the fear of maybe not having a job in a couple of months could be annoying. But personally I like to think of it as liberating.
Hi there, I've not worked at any of the companies you've mentioned but I have experience in both startups and digital agencies (currently working for a moderately successful startup).

I found that your life at digital agencies will be almost entirely dictated by the skill of the sales team, in my experiences the technology used for the end product will be dictated by them (as a way to sell) as well as the types of projects that come in.

Agency work is also much more client facing, I enjoyed this quite a bit and miss it at my current job. It was not uncommon to have direct contact with the client to work with them for their needs, startups tend to be more figure headed by a few people who want creative control of the project. This means that at an agency you as an individual are more integral to the success / failure of any given project.

From my personal experience I've had to work more overtime at agencies than any startup, due to individuals being more integral to the success / failure of projects if management / feature-creep send it sideways you will likely be the one who has to pick up the brunt of it. Your mileage will vary on this one depending on how experienced your agency is at dealing with client demands.

I'm currently working at a startup and personally enjoying it far more, there is a lot more freedom to experiment with technology and working hours / location are very flexible. The challenges we are facing are also a lot more difficult than anything I worked with at an agency, it feels less like improving how efficiently I can crank out a site / webapp and more incrementally improving a product, more time for testing and benchmarking etc. I do miss the variety and people though.

Hope that helps!

I did exactly this as a frontend dev.  I wrote about it for InVision: http://blog.invisionapp.com/from-agency-pro-to-startup-newbie-developer-edition/

Basically, from my experience, agency is better for work/life balance and startup is better for learning new things. Completely depends on team goals because you can get whatever you want out of either of them.
I have worked on both environments. Honestly speaking if you are junior developer, I'd advice you to go the digital agency route, as this option gives you more space to learn and exposes you to different projects. 

What comes to startups: startups will be less concerned about doing it "right" as they will be as doing it "now". So you do have more free hands as long the job gets done. But this is being accompanied with bigger responsibilities as well.
I just started working as a junior dev in an agency 2 months ago. My primary skills lie in LAMP with an ok grasp of JavaScript, since being there I've worked Drupal sites, in-house frameworks, Android (thank god I took an intro to mobile development and Java...) and responsive design. Great for experience but there's hardly a day I don't think "what am I doing...?".

I will say that the people I work with are mostly great, couple that are taking a while to warm up to but otherwise everyone's great to work with. Like others have said its very client focused and if you like silence, good luck haha. My team are mostly working with outdated (2010ish) tech, heavy on the jQuery and no sign of package management but are open to what I can bring to the table technology wise. Can't comment on startup work yet. 
The digital agency I work at has a culture almost like startups due to its small size, and everything I did was pretty free-form in workflow. This has its pros and cons. You get to follow your own approach as long as it met deadlines, but without a well-structured team, you tend to go all cowboy with the code. But I usually had some input on what we could use to build the website with. Project managers write Request for Proposal documents for the clients, which are usually the only written documentation developers and designers get as a guide for making the website.

The irony here is that software is still the primary product of digital agencies, but without the big concerns of code quality that you'd expect from a typical software company. That's because agencies are deadline-heavy businesses that depend on developers to deliver a finished product on time in order to make revenue. 

From someone else that worked at an agency he found out this was very much the case, as they bill clients by the hour. Things like unit testing, updating production applications, automation, pair programming and code reviews were considered a waste of time.

Most software companies have products that concurrently create revenue while new features are being built, and so are relatively less deadline-heavy. In the worst cases, if they bill clients by the hour, it creates a perverse incentive to slack off and do the minimum work.
I think you definitely hit the nail on the head. In our agency we have a support team which are generally spending only 1 or 2 days a week doing bug fixes and small projects for our clients, but most of my work is project based. We have client A who needs this extention to their site (auction site is now expanding to do property auctions, not just fine art for example) the project is scoped by our client managers. and i get a spec of what they want, spend 6 weeks doing it, then we may have a few days doing amends at the end after client has tested the site. I love it. each project is fresh and new, doesnt get stale and i dont get bogged down doing the same stuff
I've just left the agency life. I thought I'd really enjoy jumping from project to project, variety is the spice of life and all that. But actually what I've found is that I can't get emotionally invested in anything I'm doing, because a lot of the time I didn't get a chance to even see what I was working on go into production, or see how people used it. Felt like what I was doing wasn't having any impact.

Maybe that's better at other agencies though.
Great, your perspective was actually my initial assumption. Super helpful, thanks!
Same here. First startup failed, they started a new one, switched to the new one. 
 
I like having to build something from the ground up, instead of multiple smaller projects per year. 
Did you find it difficult or otherwise challenging to jump into the start-up world coming from an agency? That is, were hiring managers or seniors devs hesitant to hire you given your experience at an agency?
Thanks! Did you find it difficult or otherwise challenging to jump into the start-up world coming from an agency? That is, were hiring managers or seniors devs hesitant to hire you given your experience at an agency?
That was my experience with agency work as well - the tech stack lags a bit behind, probably because the focus is on billable hours and not on code as craft.

It's not worse, just different. It was a great learning experience for me.
That's a problem I had in the agency I worked at. The company wasn't good at communicating the customer feedback to us. There is no serious attempt to follow up with them to see how well did our project achieve the goals for the clients.

Not really, I'd had experience in start-ups before. Ironically I changed to the agency model cause that's what I thought I wanted.
As the css expands (displays) the div based on whether the input is checked, default to having the first input checked:

    <input id="_1" type="checkbox" checked>
