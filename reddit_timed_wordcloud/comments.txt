I just want to enjoy being Cubs fans.. not for people to think i'm an evil shill because I lean liberal, or for people to think a conservative is some racist poor-person hater. 
He's done seven innings in two starts - as in seven innings total over two starts.
Yeah, or you could say that it is evenly split between the 7, 8, 9 spots and the 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 spots, because that's just how percentages work.

5, 6, & 7 is more like 85%, which is still the lion's share, of course.
Yeah, good point, it's a complex problem. On one hand, every bit of playoff experience helps for a kid you've made (hopefully) a career commitment to. 

On the other hand, it's slightly arrogant to have a long-term view because all playoff opportunities are precious and we're in the midst of an offensive production slump.  

Also, isn't Addy historically worse against LHP? 

Comes down to trends and matchups and, for this series, I worry Addy is disadvantageous. I would love to be proven wrong, believe me. He's amazing. 
I think we've been doing small ball fine in the first few innings of games- we just need to find a way to sustain it throughout the game beyond just innings 1-3 and 7-9.
Isnt sign stealing basically accepted throughout the majors? Only for players though. If we had a guy in the stands then I can understand it but not something so basic like a giy on second base trying to see what pitch is next
By that logic you could say time is evenly split between hitting in the 5-6 spots, or the 7,8,9,1,2,3,4 spots. When in reality he was hitting 5, 6, or 7 spot 95% of the time.,
I mean the ball barely made it to the warning track, so it's not like this was some great missed opportunity or something

We got "lucky" in Game 1 last round against the Giants with Baez home run and Posey's double in the 9th that game too 
He's talking about Gonzalez for Rizzo, though I think it's a pretty huge stretch to assume it'll come up, given that neither were traded to the teams they are with now through that transaction.
74 of his 151 games in the 7 spot or later is close to half, so I think you could make the case that "primarily" is a stretch.

Addy is pretty evenly split between hitting in a 5-6 spots and the 7-9 spots.

I stand by my statistical analysis.
There is no way Hill is better than both Lester and Hendricks this year 
The one game they play like shit and they get called for stealing signs...Does this seem backwards to anybody?!?
we got "unlucky" in the same way we were "lucky" during game 1 of the Giants series. 

The universe works itself out I guess 
>every postseason he's been in

This season and last season?
Thanks for explaining, not sure I see the connection, but thanks for explaining.
I like how this article contributes to Cubs conversation very greatl-- oh wait.
who has potentially three more games left in this season if he can't start contributing at the plate 
He said that he hit primarily in the 7 spot or later.

I am saying that he hit primarily in the 5-7 spot. He was in the 8-9 spot so few times it isnt even worth mentioning.
Did you even watch the video? 


edit: ill take that as a no
We won a 1-0 game last series, things tend to balance themselves out one way or the other

this is a dangerous philosophy..
u/Frank1180, which you quoted, was discussing him in the "7 spot or later." You were addressing his point, then changed the details in your response to support your argument.

>He was in the 5-6 spot for a large portion of the year. He couldnt have been later than the 7 spot more than 5-10 times.

It just seems strange to leave the 7 spot out of consideration, especially when there's only 1 spot after it for all intents and purposes.

**EDIT:** Also, 10 times in the 8 spot by the end of May.
Perhaps the first, Utility Gold Glove winner ever?
Maybe it's related to the Dodgers, but not the Cubs. 
Oh. You are talking about the Adrian Gonzalez/ Anthony Rizzo trade. People are confused because you didn't use the names "Theo, Andrian Gonzalez, Anthony Rizzo, Boston Red Sox, or San Diego Padres" Clarification is an important part of communication, you need to really work on it. Being super vague and rambly is just a down vote waiting to happen. As apparent by this thread. 
Anymore stats to make us feel better/in all actuality worse?
if you ever need a coat stop over and ask for one...we have tons of coats, the best coats and let me tell you our coats are truly amazing
>later than the 7 spot
I looked at all our transactions that year and in the years before and after and still have no idea who you're talking about.
anybody we face at this point is worth their salt. I imagine the Dodgers fans cant be too excited to face Arrieta. I'm confident, probably more than I should be but at least I'm swaying on the side of  positive. I'm not trying to deflate the hope. 
He walked 11 with 2 hit batters during the regular season, but I understand your point. 
They are all important. Anytime you get a single game lead in a best of 7 your odds will improve significantly, and any time you lose your odds will drop. Cubs were probably 75% or so likely to win the series after game 1 and down to 50% after game 2. It's like scoring a run in a close ballgame.

There is no "must win" until you are on the verge of elimination, but every win is huge and every loss a big deal too.
Russell batted in the 7, 8, or 9 spot 10 times before the end of April.
Well, Jon, who would have ever guessed that six long years ago while he was putting together his championship team in Boston, heh heh, Theo Epstein traded away one first baseman for another. And now 6 years later that first baseman he traded away and now the centerpiece of his Cubs team is struggling while the guy he traded for is coming back to haunt him. Ironic, huh (with a Cardinals grin). 

This is coming. I know it. And it frustrates me thinking about it. 

http://www.espn.com/boston/mlb/news/story?id=5890951
What I find significant is that 538, who bases it on ELO (a statistic analysis of who beats whom over time) with a weighting for the starting pitcher matchups and home field has the Cubs at 56% likely to advance. Fangraphs, who bases it on collective player performance, has it virtually even. Of course Fangraphs has been Cubs skeptical all year because they just throw out the Cubs stellar defensive numbers as it relates to the pitching.
>If you watch the video you can see for yourself it's not deceptively edited.  

Welp, looks like we're done here
Cool story.  I can see why it might get posted in the Dodgers sub but over here? That's a stretch.  Again, I get that people really don't like the guy but take the hate boner somewhere else already.
I want:

CF Fowler
1B Rizzo
3B Bryant
2nd Baez
LF Conteras
RF Zobrist
C Ross
P Arrieta
SS Russell

This gives protection to Rizzo because Bryant is behind him and then Bryant is protected by Baez. They don't fear Rizzo when he has the likes of Heyward or Russell behind him, who are also struggling.  
If you watch the video you can see for yourself it's not deceptively edited. Unless what he cut out was "The following statement is going to be a lie:"

Plus we have a mountain of evidence from Wikileaks confirming this is exactly the kind of behavior in which the DNC/Hillary campaign engages.
Being vague doesn't generate discussion if nobody knows what you're talking about.  Like the others I have no idea what you're talking about.
I still have no idea what you are talking about. The only thing that made any sense is the name a-rod. Everything else seems like nonsensical rambling.
I'm agreeing with you, Rich Hill has a 0.53 era in his last 3 home starts and Matt Moore finished the season well at home too. It feels the same because they both are pitchers that are being written off for no reason other than their names. 
oh no, you've planted a seed of doubt in my head!!!!
Yeah, I guess this post didn't have anything to do with MLB athletes.
No idea what you're talking about...I thought the only thing we got for Theriot and Lilly (I assume this is what you're referencing...maybe there was another 2010 trade with the Dodgers I've forgotten) was Blake DeWitt (anyone remember him? Man, there were some bad players on the 2009-2014 Chicago Cubs) and three or four specs that never worked out. But maybe you're remembering something different?
I think you move Addi down in the order because you cant move him from SS. Soler hasn't impressed PH and his bat isn't worth Addi's defense. People are forgetting that Zobrist does not make the plays that Javy does at 2B. 
He is an extremely timely hitter, there is no doubting that. He has benefited from being further back in the lineup. He would have a lot less RBI's if he were in the 2-hole. 


With that being said, he is hitting 0.173 since the beginning of September (19/110). He is hitting 0.223 since the ASB. 



>batting in the 7 spot or later


He was in the 5-6 spot for a large portion of the year. He couldnt have been later than the 7 spot more than 5-10 times.

> Addy's confidence is shaken.

So you bench him and shake his confidence even more? 
Benching an MVP candidate because he's been BABIP unlucky over a handful of games would be the worst kind of overreaction and a fire-able offense. You can make a case that Soler, Coghlan and Contreras could get starts over Russell and Heyward, depending on the matchup, but even then - you'd be degrading the defense significantly to do so.

I would support Almora over Heyward against a LHP. But that's based on a season's worth of stats, not a handful of unlucky plate appearances.
They do small groups on the left field porch as well if you want to be in the stadium.  No idea how much that costs, you'd have to contact the ticket office.
Might be somehow less reputable than Trump
Haha thanks for the offer but that'll be a negative, my friend.
Except we can very clearly see a good performance from Hill as a very reasonable outcome.
I honestly don't see how you could say Hill has been better than 2 Cy-Young front-runners
you could always join our pro Trump circle jerk at r/the_donald
Thanks for the heads-up.  I generally only use ESPN for checking scores.  Obviously, I've been avoiding Deadspin as well - we all know what their politics are but ever since Gawker got shut down, they've been shit-spamming & cross-posting politics every other damn post.  

Anyhow, this post really doesn't need to be here.  I don't begrudge anyone for disliking Trump but it'd be nice if people went elsewhere with their hate boner for the guy.  Take that shit to r/all or r/politics  and keep it off of r/CHICubs 
This feels like Matt Moore all over again. 
good now i have even more of a reason to hate him
The reality of the situation is that even if they have been struggling like crazy, you look forward, not backwards.  Cubs are still in a very good spot.  If there bats start moving next game, no one will be talking about this. They realistically need to have at least 2 out of 4 productive games for them to contribute.
Ok. That confirms that they havent talked about it at all. I am vague on purpose as I dont want those lazy guys to hook on to a stupid anti Cub storyline.  I could hear the announcers yukking it up over this and I know it's coming as soon as the light turns on for someone.
Isn't this part of the reason they're putting a hotel right next to the stadium? Or am I off on this?
Definitely don't gontonespn
I'm waiting for a Cubs fan to grab my pussy. I made it relevant right there. 
Just for shits and giggles I checked out some other articles on this "Real Clear Politics" website, which *clearly*, ahem, has no political biases or slants, and I found this:

http://thefederalist.com/2016/10/17/im-sexual-assault-victim-still-supports-trump/

All that needs to be said, really.

Good day.
Wait. You're using a video from James O'Keefe as proof? This is the guy that has deceptively edited videos multiple times to drum up false controversies. I wouldn't trust anything from this guy.
It's related to the Cubs-Dodgers series. If you don't feel it adds to the content of the sub, downvote and hide it?
Can we not mischaracterize BLM protests? Whatever your perspective on the issue of allegations of police brutality, can we recognize that these protests go on not because guys are "hood rats" but because they believe that there's a fundamental injustice in society. Not saying they're right, necessarily, but there's more meaning behind these protests than many people are willing to acknowledge.

Also, is there any actual evidence that ratings are down because of that specifically?
what?
Cubbies winning will cause the most justifiable riots in history!
Nice! Means they're about to go break out. 
Very true. Obviously it will shake the whole establishment if he takes power, but I'm mostly interested in the entertainment value of the SJW folks going insane.
Speaking of people whose victories I fully expect to precede riots...

GO CUBS.
I agree to an extent, but vs Samardzija, Moore, and Maeda he has hit a combined 1-11, 4K, 2 BB.
Oh yeah it will be for sure. I fully expect their to be riots no matter who wins.
The wifi on board wont support streaming video but you could probably get it on radio
10 feet shallower. 
It won't be just "lefties" going into chaos. 
There's the Majestic, within walking distance. But it's small and its nothing super amazing. 
Honestly, I think the next 4 years are going to be insanely entertaining, and not in a good way, no matter who wins.
Actually rage quit in the 8th but calmed myself down and turned on the 9th. Good move on my part.

Hey, at least these are concerns rooted in reality. Not a silly superstition. I've got that going for me, I guess.
Policy aside I hope Trump wins just for the absolute chaos the lefties will go into.
Have you been paying attention to Arrieta all year? Have you looked at his splits? Do you have any idea of how good the Dodgers are against right handed pitchers?
Yea, I don't think all the Kershaw hype is justified anyways, they were so lucky none of those balls left the field.  Baez and Rizzo in particular were mere feet away from tying or winning the game.  Our bats definitely need to step up big in LA though.  This won't be an easy series.
I understand slightly inside with him literally toeing the batters box line but this was inside and at the head.
With Kershaw's accuracy that's not just an inside pitch.
He's arguably the best pitcher in baseball. He can miss inside or up but I've never seen him miss inside and up.
Didn't he just issue two walks all year? He didn't hit a single batter either, did he?
Maybe asking for him to be hit was too much but people need to call him out for the pitch. Rizzo looked very upset about the location and he usually doesn't complain because of how far he stands inside the box.
Maybe it's a bit of an overcorrection in tone, but the point is that Hill is really good and I'm puzzled why fans aren't more aware of who the Cubs are facing. Dude isn't Jesus, but he can pitch.
what cubs fan doesnt carry concern with them all the time? Its in our nature. You seem like a fan that would of given up on the cubbies last Tuesday night...




All I'm saying, is this is a time for positive news not the doom and gloom crap this sub so often succumbs to. Keep your head up fellow Cubbie bro, its post-season ball and its unpredictable. Go cubs!
It doesn't necessarily have to be Soler. Maybe Almora. Contreras has had rough stretches in left, so I'm not super confident about him in right. I'm just saying there may have to be a tradeoff here. Even if you sub in Baez for Russell. Russell is a great defender at short (better than Baez has been at the same spot), and you replace a plus defender at second with an average one. 

I personally am getting behind the Almora to right idea to try to minimize defensive loss for marginal offensive gain, especially against a lefty 
You don't like the matchup?  Lol We've got Arrieta on the mound, what's not to like?
Yep. Heyward ain't hitting lefties. Almora is a damn good defender. Just platoon the 2 of them. 
That works. Frankly, Almora should have been in right field yesterday. Almora's biggest weakness is that he never walks, but Kershaw doesn't walk guys anyway. Maddon's biggest mistake of the postseason, IMO.  
I'd love to see how this post would be taken if it was pro Trump instead. Probably would be removed honestly. Why is this even on the Cubs' sub?
How is it a legit complaint?  Lol We would have nothing to be up in arms about.  That play is what is legit.  They didn't call a no fly, then it's a fair play.
karma, duh!
I know that the Royals stayed at the Hilton on Michigan when they came to play the Cubs and Sox in August. 

I'm a fan who cares a lot about his team, and I have reasonable concerns. That's why I go through the trouble of researching these things. This isn't a Cubs cheerleading sub. It's one for general discussion about the Cubs.
Their pitching staff is not better than ours, save for one guy - and he already barely beat us. You keep arguing that defense is the reason our staff ERA is so low, so now you want to take out our best defender for Almora or Contreras who are rookies and, in Contreras' case, much lesser defenders.

I agree Contreras should be in the lineup, but not at the expense of defense. The ONLY guy who I could see being replaced is Russell, with Baez to SS and Zobrist to 2B. But even then, I don't feel comfortable with it. I feel like you're imagining this alternate universe where Soler has proven over a long period of time he's consistent.
I'd be fine with that. If that's the case though I'd move Contreras to the 6 spot, and Almora to 8. 
seriously dude, who are you rooting for? Take Rich's dick out of your mouth. 
Jeez, I was at a rooftop for this game. But I was thinking about buying tickets day of at the park. This makes me rethink ever trying that. 
Well good for him. This is relevant to anything because??
Why do you want to weaken the defense so dramatically ? In the playoffs all you're facing are really good pitchers. You need to offset that by playing your best defense every game . Why do you think Baez all of a sudden owns 2nd?
Oh my god I wish. I would seriously consider flying out there just to embrace the atmosphere
Get out of here man! I've never understood fans like you. Have some damn faith my dude, its the Cubbies and your sitting here throwing shade! Be positive or GTFO
I agree that Heyward shouldn't start against lefties, but I'd play Almora in right. We know how important defense is with our high-contact pitching, and Almora is brilliant defensively. He's also a high-contact guy that won't strikeout. 
You should think that he is a damn fine ball player just going through a little slump 
lovin' the positivity my friend! Too many folks on this thread are doom and gloom!
Maybe, or maybe he is 22 and had 95 rbis primarily batting in the 7 spot or later 
I'm in Galveston! 
Yeah Rizz. You're the man! You're our main ingredient. You're the guy that made us all start believing in Cubs baseball again. Just be you, dude. You've got this shit. 
Hill isn't Kershaw. But Hill has been excellent overall and can certainly keep the Cubs from scoring from a while. If he can similarly bridge the team to Jansen, then it'll be really tough for the Cubs to muster runs.

What if Arrieta isn't sharp? It's a reasonable question given his down stretches this year, and even more reasonable when you take into account that he struggles against lefties in particular. Not really a favorable match up for him considering that the Dodgers have lefties who *crush* righties.
I mean, he hit a homerun last night. It was 10 feet foul, but he smashed it. He'll be fine. I bet he gets hot in LA.
He's terrible. No one needs to rig shit to beat him. He's rigged it against himself. 
He is GOOD.
Even if Rich Hill is good, I can't see him shutting down the Cubs like Kershaw did. 

And if the Dodgers offense was only able to score 1 run against our starter and nothing against the Bullpen, I give the Cubs a pretty good chance for a win with Arrieta on the mound. 
Former cubs haven't been doing so well against us this year.
Meh. Who fucking cares. Trump's an ass but I come to sports to get away from that stuff and I had come here to get away from the anti-Trump circle jerk that my FB & Twitter feeds have become.
Stop letting guys on base then?
They're facing a better team with a better pitching staff and Heyward is continuing to struggle in a lineup that isn't hitting in general? Adding offense on the margin is a legitimate question for the Cubs right now.
Yeah LAs offense was better than ours (until the 8th) in game 1, and I thought we hit it better yesterday

Baseball is weird. 
I don't believe that at all. Dodgers first pitcher looked meh. Maybe I'm just super confident in this series, but I just don't have any fears about playing the dodgers, yeah the Cubs aren't really producing offense but I just idk. I'm over the moon about this year. Blind optimism? Tired of losing teams? Idk. Could be I'm not very smart but who the hell knows:p
Exactly. Keep your politics out of my baseball. 

You know how NFL viewership is way down because they let hood rats alienate their white fan base? Yea, let's keep that the fuck out of here. 
He's been aggressively going for grounders and taking himself out of position. It cost a hit in gm1 with Rondon nearly getting injured covering 1st base and it nearly cost a double play last night when he was way out of position forcing Addy to go after the lead runner. It hasn't cost the cubs yet but his dead bat isn't helping either.
Read the Dodger comments. If you would have read those you'd understand my comment. 
I was replying to the thread. 

Don't blame the ump for getting a handful of balls wrong, it happens multiple times across every baseball game ever played. 

The Cubs lost because the Cubs didn't hit any of the really really good pitches the Dodgers threw. 
All these people ready to bench Russell are ridiculous. The Cubs defense is MUCH better with **BOTH Addy & Javy** up the middle. Russell and Rizzo have looked out of sorts but Rizzo's been worse in that he's been doing *everything* wrong. Swinging at 1st pitches, taking himself out of position at first base- we're lucky his mistakes haven't been costly yet. His dead bat should be subbed out for part of game 3. Start Contreras/Zobrist or KB at first base against Hill. Put Soler or Contreras in left. The defense is only marginally compromised and we have a more productive bat in the lineup.
And he's going to like it.
Whatever. He's not very good so that's all I got
Cueto, Bumgardner....

I can keep going
sitting in the bleachers last night, I thought that ball was gone.
I mean idk, it's a legit complaint and if they did it we would all be up in arms
