it is whatever clayton kershaw says it is

FUCK 
Worst calls I've seen in ever. Fuck everything about this game.
God damn it

Whoa, pink hat guy has a reaction to something!

That first pitch call though
That's the kind of call that can blow an entire game. Let's hope it doesn't.
Ya, that first pitch was a god awful call
Needs more helicopter

The Cubs have been abysmal against aces and closers, and that's the majority ...
Because Rizzo and Russell have been awful so far. Hard to get anything going ...
They scored 8 fucking runs less than 24 hours ago 
Very strange. Good pitching locks us up bad.
Apparently their BABIP is also nearing .100 too. That doesn't help.
Locks up most teams pretty bad. That's why its good pitching.
I guess I'm saying even worse than one would think.
yeah its not like we werent facing kershaw for 162 games or anything...
We've average 5 runs per game
Not sure if you've ever looked this guy up, but apparently this Clay Kershaw ...
I dunno, that 4+ ERA isn't too impressive /s
Going into this game the same way i did against MadBum, cautiously optimistic.

as if you would be so lucky to be allowed to do so
I miss Len and JD :(
Generous calls for both pitchers so far, I think.
agreed 
Yup, definitely. Should lead to a quick game. 
And I think Pedro Baez probably won't pitch today. That'll help immensely.
Until Baez get put in...

One more inning until our best 2 innings!
But our worst defensive and pitching innings :(

My plan would be make Kershaw tire out of the game and get to the bullpen.
Man Kershaw was really jerkin' that bat....
Extra pine tar 
Looked painful. 
No joke, I feel sorry for his boyfriend, Utley.
I fucking hate this umpire
All of our comebacks are in the 8th or 9th

Then or now?
Hey fs1 I think you spent the whole pregame talking about the wrong pitcher!

Alright no homo.... but Bryant is one good looking dude. 
It's the eyes.

There's a reason his ERA isn't 0

Who do they love more. Baez or Kershaw?
Keyshawn right now

Defense like that wins games they say.
Next level baseball IQ
BAEZ FINDS A WAY
Rare emotion from Carl. I love it
Fucking genius.

Time for a big hit
Great AB Dex, now let's get a hit. 
I like this crowd.
Great AB, Dex

Man Kershaw is mowing us down 
Least it was racking up the pitch count
Homer for KB pls
The foul pop - the Kershaw special!
Good AB by Fowler just didn't get the desired result
What's up with all of these pitchers and their funky throwing motion? First i...
Smack this KB
He did, just a bit over it and right at Turner. Unlucky. Hell we got an 0.117...
That's a little unfortunate 
Oh boy. Here we go boys, hold on to your butts.

I like Monty yelling 1 1 1 1
I'M READY FOR 7TH INNING KERSH
Walks are killer
Just fuck our shit up, ump.
Joe acting like he didn't want him to do that
Thank fuck.
Good work by Monty

LETS GO BABY HE SUCKS LAYE IN THE GAME
His command seemed to be slipping last inning. Let's hope that trend continue...
I thought Kershaw never walked anyone.
#HIS NECK IS EXPOSED, END IT HERE CUBBIES 
#IIIIIIIIII FEEEL ALLIIIIIIIIIIIIIVE
I have never heard a crowd go so nuts over a leadoff walk lol 
11 walks all year
Good AB by Rizzo there.
4 pitch walk from Kershaw is a sign of something 
Please let this be the fall of Kershaw.  Postseason Kershaw please stand up, ...
LOL.

This must have been what it was like for other fans to watch their team...
LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOLLLLLLL
Did that hit Grandal in the noggin?
Almost. 
Time to wash that hat, Kershaw!
IT'S A SIGN
I'm actually a pretty big fan of Kershaw but god damn I hate the fucker right...

Ben what are you doing?
Ok that means homerun now
#2 HANDS FOR SAFETY

Cubbies breaking out those AA playoff bats
I hope Javy goes yard on him because he got cocky. 
Fuck. Damn so close.
EVERYTIME
I thought Baez had it
We all did, the whole damn stadium did... 
including Kershaw
Fuuuuck
fack
god dammit kershaw you're good
FUCK!
FUCK
Come on. Fuck what a tease
Oh man, he just missed that!
sigh
Kershaw saying his prayers there.
Fuck my blue balls 
That Sosa hop had me fooled. I was exited.
I exited when that ball was caught... 
Lol. I didn't even notice. 

Excited 
Baez had a little Sammy hop there
How many are we gonna hit to the fucking warning track? SO FUCKING FRUSTRATED...
Fucking fucking fuck fuck fuck
Need to play small ball. no more unproductive outs.
So many warning track balls fucking hell
Yesterday one of them would have been out. Just not in the winds tonight.  Go...
Alright...two innings to get a run against not Kershaw. It can be done.
If Javy hit that out...oh man
Wrigley would need to be rebuilt.
Sometimes...  I hate baseball.  
Kershaw might be done after that inning. 
Kenley though.
on my way to leave work and my car breaks down noooo
I don't want to run anything back 

Fuck Gatorade 
Strop... what was that bro.
Right, rally blanket is coming out in the bottom of the inning.
Strop plz
Juuuuust a bit inside.
Pedro....
OH BABY A DOUBLE PLAY
Strop better have a short leash he don't look good
and just like that
Nice turn by Baez
God Baez made that look easy despite running at an angle.

How the fuck does ...
Look at what he does and you'll see he has amazing control of his body, almos...
Yeah let's play that Roberts laugh one more time.
Seriously fuck that. 
Dave Roberts going full Million Dollar Man with that laugh.
Everybody's got a price! Bahahahahahaha!
Everybody has a price! 
Bryant baez rizzo. Amazing
We did it! Made it past the 8th
#RALLY BUCKET: ENGAGED
Can that bucket be used to hold all my stress barfs?
ummmm... let me take it off my head first.
Damn, I thought we had seen the end of Kershaw.
I'd rather see him. He is gassed
8TH INNING MAGIC
If you haven't yet.... rally towels. Jerseys inside out. Take a shot of Malor...
I believe in watching the Cubs do their thing. That's what I'ma gonna do
Nonchalant throw by Javy like it was warmups before the inning.
Someone cast Dave Roberts in the new Joker movie ASAP
Lets get some runs!! Rally cap engaged!
that was a cute high-five-hand-hold that kershaw just gave

2 innings of not Kershaw? Fuck yea
It's time to put miggy in again and hope he can fuck shit up for the Dodgers ...
Come on boys, just gotta scratch one across.
Kershaw is out. Time to beat up on Jansen.
Jansen is as good as Kershaw.
But at least he isn't Kershaw.
Another pinch hit dong coming 
Who's pinch hitting? Monty? Cogs?

Edit: Miggy, not Monty.
Probably Coghlan
I'd put Jake in tbh
He won't put a righty in
COME ON MONTE. 
#GUESS WHAT MIGGY'S BACK
Come on Migs... go yard again. Be the hero. 
Fack.

2 more strikes you glorious bastard
Alright. They can do this. 
What in the fuck was Puig doing there? Wow. 
Rally blanket is up to my chin now, YOU GOT THIS CUBS!
Thank god for Puig.
Good job Chapman! Lets get it going!
RALLY BUCKET
Just puig things ☺️
If Kershaw wasn't on the mound we just went up 2-0. He can't pitch everyday.
All it takes is a tie. That's it. PLZ.
Let's get 2 runs......fuck their closer
This. Is. Rizzo.
Strap in folks. This is what makes playoff baseball so great.
good game, NOW LET'S GET SOME RUNS!!!

Let's go at least put up a fight
Rally cap is on.

Time to walk it off.
That guy is doing the rally cap all wrong and it hurts inside
It's ok guys, Dex was just making his arm tired for Kris!
Fuck this ump is terrible. 
Holy fuck that was terrible. 
Right over the heart of the batters box
Not even close. Come on ump. Jesus
man that was not even close
Are you fucking shitting me
WOW
If there ever were a time for Rizzo to wake up
Ummm i KNOW joe fuck did NOT just call Kershaw the best pitcher in baseball
More like you know he DID. #dickridin'
He is. Unquestionably.

The Nats have one of the best offenses in the league. 
*cough* what's our run differential? *cough*
And we're about to beat Kershaw anyway so it's a moot point.
Rich Hill is actually surprisingly very good. I wouldn't say no one.
He's good but he's been battling injuries and didn't impress against Washington

He's okay, I think he just gets stuck with shitty color commentators. 
He's not bad, just boring. But I enjoy complaining about him.
I don't mind him for baseball. Not a fan of him for football though.

Jesus man
We keep swinging at garbage and not attacking good pitches early in the count

Tight as a nun 
 
Edit: Honestly its not bad I just really wanted to use that...
Mildly generous at times, in my opinion.
Little generous, but both pitchers have benefited from it. 
except now karl is getting squeezed
Did you not see strike 3 there?
big K hendricks!
You better give Karl the big strikezone too.
Woof, living on the edge Hendricks!
I'll take it. 
I really don't know about a lot of these pitches.
Get turner out!! Gonzalez with 2 men on is terrifying. Come on Kyle!!
wtf was that?
Monty for a long relief coming soon?

I'm pretty sure he's divorced

Bosio did
Come on Kyle make good fucking pitches.
Karl pls
Dat change
Lol that was not the best pitch. 
Deceptive change of speed can bail you out on bad located pitches
Why do they have two ball-people right next to the dugout? Seems unnecessary
One is probably the usual ball person employed by the team and the other is p...
Everything multiplies for the playoffs
think one is security that steps out in between innings 
Glad that's over.
Alright let's get some runs
Huge sigh of relief
STRUCK HIM OUT!!!!!
GOT HIM!!
Checkmate!
Sorry guys, I forgot to bribe the home plate umpire tonight
Wind definitely picking up to left 
Ruh roh.
Not too bad Proffesor get over the mistake and move on. Now lets get to Kershaw!
Huge out!  Hendricks working his way out of a jam.  
fucking swing
Not a good AB 
What the fuck was he looking at?
uh..did I miss something? why did he just stand there, not even taking a stance?
I sure hope willy was told to do that
Oh boy he's throwing a perfect game.
Alright he knows we're not swinging first pitch here, switch up strategy next...
He'll probably expect that.  Lots of first pitch curveballs next time through.
I wish Kershaw wasn't as good. :(
Time to go yard Kyle. 
Lol Kershaw with the huge curve in Kyle. He really takes no batter for granted. 
Probably a good idea considering how many RBIs they had in the NLDS
I agree, but when a pitcher is cruising, I think it can be easy to get a bit ...

My first comment was probably too reactionary, but Kershaw is a beast when he...
Wtf was that.  We trying to just reset order ?

They changed the angle from the NLDS. So you're not crazy.
I think this is more like the regular season camera angle. It definitely look...
It's a different one from the NLDS. Same one from the regular season

It was amazing cuz you could see the corners where the ball was. 
It is.

Damn it.

Hang one please
Clayshaw Kurtain
Foul a couple off, will ya?
Not even trying to make him work 
What's on the back of Kershaws hat?  Looks like mud or something. 
Has Kershaw seriously thrown only 35 pitches?
Damn shit
GOD DAMNIT
Oooooo fuck haha.. I thought that was gone
JFC SO CLOSE :(
#DAMN IT WHY
Crushing sadness has ensued :(
FUCK SO CLOSE
So fucking close. 
Damn, so close
Talk about blue balls. Fuck. 
God damn it. That looked so close. 
FUCCKKKK
He hung one and it hooks foul. Damn.
so close anthony :(
I wish.
Jesus thank God there's only one of him on this team 
There's only one of him anywhere 
FUUUUUUUUUUUUCCCCCCCKKKKKKKKKKK
Can we at least run up the count so we have a chance once they pull him?
Swallow sadness, send some faxes
Shit on Debra's desk
Good contact at least.

ITS A SNAKE 
Snek*
At the Hartford, we make clumsy baseball analogies.
Why do we just watch the first pitch go by??
Watching a lot of Konerko footage maybe. 
Crap on a Kershaw
So close :(
AHHHH SO CLOSE
Damn it that was well hit.
Shit. I thought that was going out.
Oh my god 
Damn it.
Kershaw is getting tired...
Kershaws a pretty ok pitcher. 
Again!
2 straight dingers last night? 
And tonite we have Kershaw folks. JUST KERSHAW ALL NIGHT THAT'S ALL WE'RE GOI...
Some very hard contact though. 
We're due one to go out...
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh, again. 
Come boys get a hit lol 
About to be less than 50 through 5.
So much blue balls

Now how to bring him home
Javy swings over the top of that last year.

He wears that big glove to protect his fingers/wrist on slides. I don't think...

Did he? I don't remember that, but then again I'm not very good at keeping tr...

Hm ok, Wasn't sure about it but I'm glad he's ok.
FINALLY!
Perfect game over.  A single hit like that can  turn the momentum in the play...
I half-expected Javy to try and turn that into a double.
That was a Charles Barkley swing by Baez
and the perfect game is finished!!!! Let's get some runs!!!!
JAVY guaranteed tries. 
There we go javy
If it bleeds...We can kill it.
Warning shot to Javy.
That...was the slowest pickoff I've ever seen.
J-hey pls
JASON DOUBLE? Please Heyward!!
Baez playing chess while everyone else is playing checkers.
FUCK YOUR ONE-HITTER
Baez is so funny
Javy and Wilson are killing it.
Two hits now! Same # as the Dodgers
That's right boys! Let's get that confidence going.

Heyward with a 1 RBI double. He did it last night.

Turrible 
At least they got a couple on base 
tm
The cracks begin to show!
Alright boys, time for me to sleep, give our boys some mojo to beat up Kershaw
God dammit heyward

Oh look, a shallow pop fly.
Still better than a weak grounder to 2nd.
Ah fuck 
Smoltz and the dog references lol.
That inning was over fast.
I still believe.
I never stopped
Even a God can bleed.  It's not over yet.  
Missed opportunity.

But at least we started to get to Kershaw in that inning.

yeah too low.  nothing dodger baserunners could do
Yes, too low

We've all been looking for it too
When the time comes I hope we lock up Javy

Praise the sun
Use that momentum!
Baez mental game is insanely strong
This ump is best friends with snoop dogg I think 
he's been so meh
Kershaw gonna pitch through the 8th at least
Though seriously he had time to throw it to first for the DP?
rizzo was waaaaaay off the bag
Rizzo came way off the bag for some reason 
Im glad it worked out, but Russell should've just thrown back to first for th...
No one covering first
I could be wrong, but I don't think that'd work. The batter was probably safe...
Rizzo was off the bag, allegedly
Should have just let cej bat lol
javywoo.gif
We gotta get Kershaw out of this game geez
he has 64 pitches...
Wtf Javy
This is not good
Argh pop outs
kershaw is going the distance i have a feeling
Yup because we'll score 2 off him in the bottom of the 8th to win
Can we stop messing around?
god damn kershaw
SOLER jersey has been put on

Blargh, that was a 50/50 one right there...

Almost done completing my voodoo curse on Kershaw.

Make him regret not forcing him out!
Suffice it to say, I am hoping for extreme dongage

Javy will be swinging in hero mode and I won't have it any other way.
Hope Baez goes deep and everyone starts questioning Roberts. 
Punish him for this, Baez

Like wtf it's just straight fastballs. 
Those are anything but straight 
Cutters. He throws cutters.
Wow only pete rose picked us to beat the cubs!
You mean beat the dodgers... right?
Hey guys, did you know Kershaw gets every pitch and Kyle gets zero calls????

/s
I feel like the first inning strike zone was like adult league... everything ...
so...gonna swing this time or stand there like an idiot again? 
Fuck, can't waste chances like that.

Might have been our best chance to score.
I'm getting sick of joe fuck
Wow, no faith.
For?
I can't fault him for not coming through against Kershaw, but Heyward **never...
He's saving himself for the world series. ^i ^hope
Sorry, you must have missed the game last night. I'm pretty sure he tripled l...
Christ he hit a lead off triple **LAST NIGHT**
And about a million soft rollers to 2nd before that. 
Then you must not pay close attention to the games. 
Lol you're right. That one triple erased an extremely dissappointing season w...
Had a triple last night 
Just like his triple yesterday, right?
He hit a key triple yesterday.
I swear to fucking god anyone named Gonzalez is a god damned curse on us.
You can't leave something that far out over the plate Kyle... Gotta keep it i...
yuck
That really was a wasted at bat.. 
Kershaw is so good...
I'm sure Maddon has something up his sleeve but these past couple at bats hav...
Hey guys, that was where Kyles was and it was a ball. 

Now quit yo bitching. 
PERFECT GAME
Why aren't we swinging at more first pitches? He's throwing mad strikes. 
He's thrown 50 pitches. 50.
Cuz we're looking at strikes all day. 
It's called looking at the weather forecast dumbass. That's how you know it'l...
Leave him in. 
We basically have to win every single game this series in which Kershaw doesn...
Too many ins
To hear Dodgers fans talk, Kershaw's going to pitch every game they play from...
We can still win this one that he is pitching.
No way Jason gets this at bat if it makes it to him
dafaq does that have to do with anything?
Zobrist wants to go home and bathe in his money
"Get the fuck off my mound!" Kershaw probably 
We live and die by the long ball

To be fair, so did Pat
Any wind blowing out it was gone
Probably anywhere else to the outfield and it woulda gone out without wind.
What's with the Bullpen getting out of the way? 
All or nothing time. With a runner on third and less than two outs, I saw loa...
That sounds like a great idea 
That hit off the plate!!
Kind of looked like it did
The plate is in fair territory.
So
Moving forward do you trust Contreres at left field?  Having him in the lineu...
Not gonna happen
I would do this in a heartbeat
This team is awful
fuck off 
Look at the username everyone, lol
Fuck off.
Living up to the name
Check year

Cubs win 103

In NLCS

team is awful

wot
username checks out
[deleted]
Ah shit I missed the username and didn't realize it was ironic. I feel bad now.
FUCK HENDRICKS!!! TAKE A DEEP BREATH!!!
God fucking damnit this strike zone is whack 
No it's not Jesus Christ. 
Come on it's big especially low
Does size matter?
To an extent I'd argue yeah especially early in games. Pitchers are creatures...
Dude I was making a penis joke. 
Should've pinch hit for heyward
Just bench him next game. This is unreal. 
A special message for Kyle Hendricks: Throw. Better. Pitches.

*what you were...
Well this game has been pathetic.
Dodgers: 1 run, 1 hit
 
Cubs: 0 runs, 0 hits.
 
Really not that bad... 
Hendricks is a mess
Dex single. Bryant slow grounder to third F.C., Fowler to 2nd. Rizzo doubles ...
Nope
im gonna get down voted to shit but maybe hit hit him in the knee on accident...
I can neither confirm or deny I support that. 
>im gonna get down voted to shit


Yup. You are.
lol i was totally kidding just bored by myself watching this game.. 
Is there a point where its ok to pull russel or rizzo?
As he gets a nice call

Edit: meant to reply below. Fuck it leaving it here. 
The defense is just too good at short to take him out. He will heat up. 
Yeah, when they get injured 
Rizzo? No. 
you can never pull anthony rizzo
Rizzo no, Russell absolutely
If you wanna make our defense a lot shittier at the expense of *maybe* more o...
Addison, yes. Javy can play SS. Rizzo, absolutely not?
The defense as a whole is worse with Addison off the field. Regardless of jav...
I was thinking Contreras in left, but still you make a really good point. You...

Are you a baseball fan or a Cubs fan? Idk about you but I'd rather see the Cu...
Thanks guy, you jinxed it.
Jesus Christ 
Goddamn Karl, get it together.
God damn. 
Goddamn Heyward is starting to remind me of Michael Tucker up there.
you know they are in love with him when they turn that video package for this...
Wonder if Joe would consider starting Javy at SS, BenZo at 2B, and Soler in LF
Lol why
Contreras in left 
Soler is no better than Addy at the plate 
0-5, only one start. Part of it too though is I feel a bit on edge with BenZo...
Why didn't their manager take him out?! I wanted to get to their bullpen! 
it's gonna be jansen for the rest of the way i bet

When it looks like he crushes a ball and gets good extension it only goes hal...

I wouldn't say now is exactly the time to start experimenting, but what do I ...
well their defense really won't be worth it in the bottom of the 9th
Would have been hilarious if they both blew out a shoulder doing that stupid ...
naw let's not wish for people to get hurt
Oh fine. 
kershaw is pitching ten pitches an inning, this isn't going well
The whole order in 31 pitches lmao. I know it's Kershaw and offense has been ...
Fuck... Not even 4 pitches per batter faced.
Wow that fucking kershaw circle jerk video
We have never been able to touch Jansen. Even 1 run is a tall task.
Cubs are responsible for one of his blown saves this year 
BELIEVE OR LEAVE!
BELEAVE 
Two runs against best closer in world please.
Holy shit when did the Dodgers get Zach Britton?
We're not facing the best closer
Nah, Britton is better.
Zobrist is weak...
Is Ken Rosenthal's voice annoying for anyone else?  I can't figure out whethe...
those bow ties represent charities or have something to do with charity work ...
That's fair - never said he was a bad guy, just not a fan.  Good on him though.
hooooooly cow this is terrible
Heyward you fuck 
Like the rest of the team has just been going yard all night.
I'm done with Addison. I don't care that he's good at defense. So is Javy.
Game was over when Heyward popped up. Absolutely have to win every non Kersha...
Didn't realize Kershaw is starting three more games this series...
Dude. Top of the order is up. 
Well I'll give you this much you've been consistently the most negative perso...

I'd be happy if you never posted in this subreddit again
Because the team is doing bad and I pointed it out?
Should we just be happily...
Because you're being a downer for no reason when we aren't even doing too bad. 
Our top four going 0/17 isn't bad? Being no hit through half the game (was it...
Not pinch hitting for Heyward there is one of the biggest mistakes of Maddon'...
I'm flaired up for Baeward, but I think you are right. I know his defense is ...
Relax 
this comment is a mistake
no it isnt
We are so fucked. Kershaw is on point and the ump is doing us no favors
Go away.
3 innings...it has been only 3 innings.
Game over, rebuild, trade Kane...shit wrong sub.
still think we should bean him.. lol 
Yeah, I'm sure a bruise on his thigh is gonna change a lot
So the Dodgers bean Baez? Why would you want to start that shit? 
Perhaps you shouldn't "think", as you put it, so much.
This is the Chicago Cubs, not the St. Louis Cubs 
dont be that guy
No lol
remember me saying this when he pitches the rest of the series hahahahahaha 
I don't think you know how baseball works 
it was a joke everyone.... damn y'all butts are tight tonight 
It was a joke but a really shitty one ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ 
/r/buccos is that way------->
That would be dumb.
its a joke... sense of humor.... yeahhhhhhh
 - - Pittsburgh Pirates
Adrian's got a great chance to go deep here. Get Montgomery up two batters ago.
What happened to bring positive? Are you not watching this team? 
Damn, havn't been in a GDT thread in awhile and Dr. Claw is being a negative ...
Cowards need to throw the fucking ball over the plate.
lol
Fowler let Jason take that one next time
heyward would have had to slightly turn, dexter made more sense
Fowler is in a much better position to make that throw. 100% Dex's ball.
Fowler had a better position.  Heyward moving to his right when he throws wit...
[removed]
Didn't you quit on the team last series?
Yo chill the fuck out. It's one game, that's not even over yet
I'm gonna go out on a limb and say Soler wouldn't have hit well
K dude. Very nice of you to continually repeat this.
Every non Kershaw? He's only starting 2 games 
He'll pitch in at least three.
He's not starting 3. And he'll only pitch in 3 if it goes 7 
We have to win five games. That's how best of seven series works. Just like h...
Remind me how Soler hits curveballs? You know who throws a filthy curveballs?...
OMFG it's GAME 2.

Jesus tapdancing Christ! Did you seriously put all your ho...

Must. Resist. Urge. To. Downvote.
