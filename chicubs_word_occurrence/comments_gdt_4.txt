Fuck me yes him. 
I know you mean Lackey but have an update anyway! 
Yeah. That guy too!

Damn it yes. 
Y'mean Lackey?

That's alright, double play ball right here.
DP and I'll chug another beer
Bet you won't do it anyways. 
Your flair D:
I changed it per my deal with the BABIP gods. They were kind, so it stays.
Ahhhh ok.
"That sets a sour taste, not just in your manager's...scenario."  
  
What?
Lackey please don't go full Ortiz in the dugout.
Lackey is PISSED

Shit. His command was clearly dying.

Good performance though.
this game is going to be six hours long and still only nine innings

Because October!
But the dodgers have so many stress free innings. It's not fair!
You can't pin that shit on Monty but damn that is a game changer right there.
You can though. He needed the awareness to know that's a DP ball there. He al...
I find it hard to blame pitchers for the instinct to catch the ball. Just me ...
Well it's the difference between 5-0 and 5-2. Pretty big mistake 
ok that could have been a lot fucking worse really
Damage minimized, thank god.
2 is okay. Let's score some more!!!!!
Couple of insurance runs this inning k??
Could have been much worse that inning. Lock that pen down. 
About 4 more runs here would be great.
No lead is safe we need a run or two to help protect this lead lets go cubs! ...
Sitting at LA Fitness, Cubs beating LA, witness
Credit to Monty for not stumbling into that ball batted right into his way.
So it turns out you can hit the baseballs and then someone doesn't catch them...
Ump was almost road kill!

he swung at the first pitch that's good at least
Guys, did you know Urias is 20? /s
Cubs are due for some breaks. A lot of breaks, actually. 
Hit a double into a gap Jason please 
why can't he catch up to 92
When he steps his ankle is turned - dude is all kinds of messed up at the plate
Let's go J-Hey, launch that sucker!

He's seen things.

Can we have one of those drop please? ffs
Everything right at them
Hard to win a game when the BABIP gods have it out for you 
So like, this team can't hit a breaking ball anymore?  What happened?
What if we win without a hit

that would be history, right?
No
I want to see where this happened

Really need a hit from Heyward here. 
Urias pitches at the same pace as Pedro Baez does with runners on. 
That's impossible...right?
Mark Buehrle in an alternate universe 
He was such an awesome dude.
Much better ABs all around this inning
So far this is a good AB from heyward
Battling. Cmon JHey!
Willson needs to keep his on eye on Urias...making me nervous.
nice beard urias
that was a meat pitch
Can't even be upset about that AB.
Damn it Jason.
SO glad we have Heyward in there to continue to do absolutely nothing.
Well, jeyhey didn't hit into a DP so that's good.
Is it possible for strikeouts to be worth 184 mil?
$184 million 
At least we're getting some decently long at bats...
Looks like LOBster is on the menu tonight 
Good contact at least. damn.
Loud out tho
Cubs sure like making these pitchers feel confident.
Damn good wood just not quite there. 
*sigh* at least we had something going for a change
Oh fucking come on - great swing and just can't catch a break
at least he drove it

but FUCK
Sigh, finally gets decent wood on the ball but hit it to damn high
Damn it. At least he drove the ball somewhere.
All outfield fences should be 10 feet closer to the plate.
That "just off the plate" ball to Russell actually wasn't close at all.
I thought it was closer than it was too

Waddup positive vibes comrade!
What a beautiful pitch
Gonzalez is a slow motherfucker
Dman gonzales is slow
Fuck, he's safe
Heyward, why are you taking your time on the throw?
fuck.... he looks safe
Hand was hovering over the plate when tag was made. Hand not down... OUT
Kms if that's safe

Tag him in arm, the hand, anywhere else, Willson...
Wait did they just announce him safe before the umpires got the decision?
It's pretty clear
You're delusional if you think that's safe.
C'mon man
It wasn't even close based on the shot they had on TV
called him out
He's out. There's no way! 
What a fucking terrible throw wtf Heyward 
Outcome irrespective, Willy has to go to the plate. Not the face.
Fingers are up
Does it not look like like he got the arm? 
It looks like he's safe, but at the same time you don't know if the glove hit...
Way too close to call.
there was a gap under between his fingers and the plate
wow we got a break
YEAH BOYYYYYYYY
OUT!!!!!!!!!!
We probably got away with one. Let's do something for it.
He got his arm

WHY DO THEY CATCH EVERYTHING
How many guys they got in the outfield?
Angels
7
Worried that karma will keep us from scoring for the next 15 innings. 
not our fault the replay guys in NYC decided not to overturn
Maybe it is reverse karma in the form of the last two games
Then I guess we will just have to win in the 18th inning!

Well that's unfortunate.
Ugh damnit
Please stop walking and finish this my god.

Nothing like coming back to the blue brothers

OH SHIT I DIDN'T THINK I COULD BE MORE HYPED BUT I AM
Haha, Nintendo and Cubs are two of my favorite things.
SAME HERE
So pumped
Holy shit what is this pitcher?
wow! lots of empty seats there el ay.
I just can't comprehend these empty seats.  
Traffic in LA is a bitch.
It's taken me over 2 hours to get 10 miles outside of Chicago.
I hear ya.
and they look so comfy too...
KB balls deep in OBP tonight.
Don't you be hitting my KB.
Goodnight guys. Great game! 
Still need 6 outs! Don't jinx it!
:( but im tired
You can sleep, but you'll miss the celebration (or apocalyptic collapse thread)!
I'll read it in 4 hours lol
Don't you hurt kb
Those seats look really empty weird.
Wow Dodgers fans are salads
He needs that bat
Wow, Rizzo got his mojo back?

So so glad Rizzo (and Russell) are back tonight!
There we go Rizzo

so much for shifting everyone right. 
This game finally brought our lil boy back! 
"The Bat"
Puig saved a run. Nice play.
Holy shit what a catch
Man, good defense gives me an erection no matter who makes the play.
Okay, fine. Good catch Puig.
Did he say Puig's throw hit Bryzzo?
RIZZO is alive!!!
A hell of a snatch
Damn. That was a hell of a catch.
CEJ left hamstring tightness. 
Does that type of intellectual property announcement have an industry term?
Tight hammy for Carl's jr 
"Game break time!
*dead silence*
Geez, 11 pitchers between both teams so far. 
Jackie and Kelso are Dodgers fans.
And Bears fans. Kinda weird. 
What? A 123 inning? That's a thing?
You'd think how terrible Buck called that 2004 PS, he'd want to forget it. 
lol why would they show the bar in the top of 9th when the game is over?
Boredom with the game
Fuck yeah Addi. 
**Addison Ruthless...ell**
Fuck yes.

The bats are back!!!
Russell! Killing it tonight.
FUCK JOE BUCK, controversy my ass, there was a black shadow under his fingers...
If you think that was the right call, you are a homer.

Almost as funny as LITTERALLY EVERY FUCKING TIME THE DODGERS ARE PITCHING 
Fucking Heyward can't even do the only thing we have him in the game for.

God, you suck
You mistake me for our offense.
Holy shit you're so funny!

Hard to have faith in a guy with that many mechanical flaws. 
At least we're making some solid contact.
We're going to murder the cover off the ball the second time through. 
Too close to overturn I think.
Proof needs to be conclusive right? He's out.
I think he's out. Tag was made before the runner's hand angled down enough to...
Who fucking cares if TV has safe? 
He was acting as if Fox is credible lmao
No shit. They have been up the Dodgers ass all series so of course they would...
terrrrrible call. MLB trying to save face.  That was safe.
We deserve that. 
No you dont
HAHAHAHA YESSSS! The salty Dodger tears sustain me!

Also, he was probably safe.
GOD DAMN FUCKING BABIP

Players should be shamed publicly for insisting on replay and being wrong.
Hey, that's what Heyward's in there for though, right!? Useless.
HOW DO YOU LET ADRIAN GONZALEZ BEAT YOU TO THE PLATE?!??!?!?!
Heyward is out there fucking picking his ass before he makes the throw. 
Hovering hand..
Knew it. Suck a dick LA.
IT WAS TOO CLOSE TO OVERTURN
gonzalez's hands seemed like was in the air when contreras touched him
These announcers hate us
> "this game is rigged for money"

> Chicago is a smaller market than LA

ok
eh the cubs are a huge market
But if you're rigging this game for a huge market, LA is bigger.
I really don't like being no-hit beyond 3 innings.
I still love you rizzo <3

This reminds me of last night. Wonder why.
Pete Rose never has anything good to say about the Cubs 
That fuckin' Keith Moreland cost him a lot of money back in the day.
Frank Thomas is a gigantic man.
Arguably? Who's arguing against it?
Please don't go random dude Cy Young for the third time this postseason. 
When our bats get going, it's going to be down hill for the Dodgers
Let fuckin go boys. New day, new life.

Alrighty, game is underway and I've also donned some exciting socks!
BAA is crazy low this October across the board. 
Anybody know how Dexter and Zobrist compare batting from left and right?
Two easy groundouts
Well then...
That hesitation killed him
I wonder if Urias had Bell's palsy? I only ask cause I had it too.
IIRC he had a tumor removed as a child which is why he has the lazy eye
Fantastic take there. 
He totally came around! /s
bleh
Well damn, we needed that first inning to go a little differently 
Isn't Lackey the only other rookie Pitcher to ever play in and win a playoff ...

Let's go defense 
Lackey looks like the guy off that tv show Grimm.
Whoops.

Cubs haven't worked a pitching count like this early yet
oh javy
Come on Baez.... 
Ginge cunt
They are booing. Ridiculous
No way. Nope. No way. 
Can Baez plant his feet and throw?
Hello darkness my old friend
Lol at the Lackey reaction.

Fucking magician. 
There's the spark
So actual question, what happens with AGon's AB now since the final out was g...
He leads off next inning.
Starts off the inning with the count reset
He starts the next inning at 0-0
Starts over clean next inning. Doesn't count as an official AB.
He leads off
He gets a fresh AB next inning
He is up in the bottom of the 2nd.
Resets to 0-0. I think.
Hes up again
He's banished from baseball and needs to start over as an avocado farmer.
He starts fresh next inning. 
Just got home, 0-0 so that seems good so far!
how long will tonights game last?  
Big willy style
Give me 2 fucking Runs here boys let's go!
Can we please get some new commercials?

Has anyone else ever seen a catcher pick off throw to 2nd base? I haven't.
Holy shit someone is ahead in a count!
Yeah these batting swings are lacking conviction.
That's a start Javy.
Baez with a walk? Bizaro world

Baez gives a shit. 
It's time to take advantage. 
Good eye Javy. Lets get him over

Tag the fucking plate
GOD FUCKING DAMNIT YOU HAVE TO BE FUCKIN ME GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD
Damn it. He looks safe. 
Heyward has a cannon for an arm.
Lackey's lost three calls at the knees to lefties so far, including at least ...
LET'S FUCKING GO COME ON
Ah fuck, that could be safe
Fuck. safe
Fuck. No. god. No. 
It looked like Heyward hesitated on the throw.

Who the fuck is Toles? Seriously?
Oh shit.
Are you serious? I'M DONE
OH COME THE FUCK ON
Oh no
bad tag willy
Damn it looks like he was just safe.
Put that glove down dammit
Put your body on the line Wilson
The ball wasn't there in time. Had to reach for it.
I think he grazed the arm. Need more angles
I will not survive this game
I wish I could wag my finger and the umps would review any call. 
JHey with a gun. Poor tag. Gotta put the glove on the front of the plate. 
Hit his face first 
looks to me like his hand was over the plate but wasn't touching it when he w...
I wanna say he slid up the arm there 
I'm scared, this tag is definitely up in the air...
He was safe. Lets get this game going

GO BUCK YOURSELF
I wouldn't mind 5 runs this inning, my anxiety can't handle another close game.
I hope the series turns on that.
2nd time through the lineup..lets get some hits!
Good swings today at least.
We have had that all series they just hit them right at people
We need a hit
come on boys everyone knows you've got some dingers in you, every one of you....
Literally nothing is landing on the ground, Jesus.
It's like a fly to the light, the ball to their glove every time. 
Attack the first pitch Kris!
Wow I'm shocked that was caught 
I've about had it with this Andrew Toles shit
Haha was that really not strike 3?
This offense...its scoreless innings streak is quickly approaching my age 
Come on Rizzo I believe in you
Anthony my friend - if ever there was a time to snap it...
C'mon Rizz! 
Come on Rizzo.  I BELIEVE 
is he still whining?   
He's just not squaring it up, is he?

Little close for comfort there damn! 
Eat shit, Utley.

That was a little closer than i'd have liked. 
Closer than a new couple during their honeymoon phase.
Sweet baby rays that was scary

i felt my heart skip a beat, or four. 
at least we get out of this inning without anything happening

Not again. Come on Willson - fix that shit.
see grandal, willson can frame some strikwes too 
I wish Lackey could have a mic on like they do with NFL players.

Damn Rizz.... So close again

Rizzo needed that HR. 
Is Larry King shrinking as the game goes on, or is it just me?
My heart....
I think Lackey just spit out a tooth.
Damnit. So close Rizzo.
GAH just let Rizzy get a hit!
Holy fuck what a rip SO CLOSE ughhhh

If they can show like 5 replays between pitches, you pitch too slow. 
Sooooo close. Nice damn swing there. 
That would have been perfect.

Not like this.
Fucking hell. Please limit the damage.
I would be scared to take Lackey out out I were Joe

Hm, this is not ideal exactly.
Wellllllllllllllllll sheeeeeeeeeeit

Ugh...
GOD DAMNIT MY NERVES

WE NEED SOME DP UP IN HERE
huge k here for montgomery
Strike and and a double play let's go Montgomery
Come on Monty...
Why would he bring in CJ though when Turner has reverse splits?
Hands-helmet and Malört, give me the strength to survive this inning.
Pop up(or k), then double play. I believe 
Maddon must be the most hydrated guy on the planet
#K
YES!
I love you Monty
Fucking right Monty! 
1 down! Keep it up Mike!
Dat pitch tho.

DOUBLE PLAY TIME
YES!
#YUUUUUGE K
i hate seeing larry king so old he can't even stand up :(
Keep Monty in.  He's feeling it.
SGO
What a MASSIVE out
If we get out of this inning unscathed, I will definitely drink a beer 
You want to get a bit...*hoppy?*

I have no idea where I'm going with that.
Dont need double plays if you've got K's!
Seager is a very scary hitter
FUCKING DIRTY
Now for some sweet sweet DP to end the inning 
DP DP DP DP DP
Nice K, now Mike's going to roll him up here.
Weird splits on Turner. He's like an honorary left-hander among all the other...
.... wtf monty?
lol
Just our fucking luck damn it.  Shake it off.
FUCK
Wtf man
holy moly what terrible luck
Sumbitch
What a fuck up. 
Jesus fuck 
FUCK YOU LA YOU LUCKY FUCKS FUCK YOU FUCK YOU
Monty just fucked up our DP. Way to go.
Why Mike why.
What the fuck?
Gods I can't watch.
E1?
GOD FUCKING DAMMIT
That's baseball 101 Montgomery. It's a double play. 
Fuck, error all over that
Well that looked stupid 
FUCK
Oof, that was unfortunate.
Shit Mike! Keep your glove down!
That was hard to watch
*Not like this*
Are you fucking kidding me

Whelp. don't give them any more.
holy shit that was so fucking easy FUCK
Got the DP still in order, we're up and our bats are alive. It's ok guys 
that was bullshit
That's just unlucky, honestly.
If we didn't have bad luck we'd have none at all 
of course 
okay you need one more out

chowing down on lentils...
> lentils

disgusting
Californians. They're ...weird.
Why not attempt the DP? Looked like he had that option.
Because by looking at the runner instead, he prevented a score.
I would like one out please. 
for the love of god, please limit the damage to 2
Let the defense make that play. Christ, Mike. C'mon. 
Well, damn.

So, my flair isn't showing up. How does everyone else do it?
Cue Castro gif

Welp, two is not bad.
Montgomery did some great pitching in that inning, y'all.

With Lester? I'd be shocked if it wasn't Ross. Can't figure out how they'd ge...
Left field. 
And take out Zob, the guy who got us going this game? Don't see it.
J hey 
We'll see what Joe thinks.
Trust in Joe. 
Ross is Lester's catcher
Put him in left. 
Wouldn't mind seeing him in right field
Outfield.

good lord how is he not making solid contact
Come on Heyward!
Fuck
No way they give him anything to hit.
Let's do this Addi
Jay-K... Let's go Addi
Need a slump breaker 
Jesus, he swung underneath every ball during that at bat
This is where he gets out of his slump.
Break it open Addison
Please 
You gotta swing at that.
Hayward needs something to go right for him.
He doesn't look like he's seeing the ball well.
Addison has no confidence right now. 
Russell and the rest of the cubs need to execute on that curveball right down...
COME

Couldn't even strike him out with 4 strikes.

Thanks for walking 2 you horse toothed fuckbag.
Woh, Lackey did his job. Chill out.
Walking 8 and 9 is doing his job?
Odds of a Seger base hit here? 
Zero. He isn't even up to bat.

Yes I understand. Just tired of seeing him make soft contact.

Thank God
That's just unlucky now
Wrigley field needs rally towels
Best case scenario, we only give up a couple of runs.
I thought this was going too smoothly 
And Russel almost just threw that ball into the dirt.
Does anyone else get flashbacks of Alex Gonzalez every time a ball is hit to ...
no
i do
