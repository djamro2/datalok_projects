We hit kershaw harder than rich hill. Think about that.
This offense is absolutely trash.
Relax. 
I see a lead if we take tomorrow. The pitching matchups will be interesting
Kershaw will pitch every game for the Dodgers. 
Rich Hill > Jake Arrieta. 
No. Dodgers offense > Cubs offense.

right now 103 doesn't even represent our batting average.
Doesn't mean anything in the post season, since #1 teams rarely win it all.

Goddamnit. Way to waste a golden opportunity to score a few runs.
Jesus fucking christ.

I've been saying it the entire season, Jake's control is an issue.
You're the only person who's noticed that.

A bigger issue is our lineup not hitting for SHIT
Its hard when you can't get a feel for the zone.
We're not scoring 4 runs unless somebody wakes the fuck up. 
We need to kill every fucking goat

Seriously. Why can't I hear the commentary on FS1?
I you can't actually hear it, you're not missing much. 
You're complaining about that? it sounds like bliss.

Cubs' motto is 'We Don't Quit.'

Gotta have faith.
Might as well be losing 100-0 if we can't hit. . . .

OH MAN THAT WAS NASTY
Wheres that one?? 
Getting squeezed in the zone.
Oh my god Miggy get it to him. 
SOLER ON THE FLY
Alright alright, let's go boys!!!! 
Finna get a triple dong here 
What's the wind like at the stadium?
ESPN radio said it is a non factor tonight
Gameday says 4mph out to CF, so not a big factor. 
Thought that ball was gonna reach me, I'm too fucking nervous lol
Alright let's see that Rizzo bat come to life
Love Baez playing short right field, if he got that is that putout 10????!!
Twice as many pitches as hill? Oh boy.
I think you need to re-math.

They're insecure about their shitty pitch tracking software 
Does Rich Hill throw anything other than a fastball or curveball?
Changeup 
No
Damn Rizzo, that was your pitch
Throw another hanging curve.
Fuck you Joe Buck
Holy fucking shit that movement. 
He's seeing the ball really well right now. Good sign here.
Hill's eyes are scarily far apart. 
Not with 2 strikes, but a push bunt for Rizzo wouldn't be the worst idea with...
Moved his arm in? Fuck off. 
Great AB there Rizzo.
Good job Rizzo getting a helluva lot of pitches on that

no, it just wasnt an 'incredible' at bat
Larry King?
damn
worked the count well then swung at ball 4
lmao "belt high" that was chest high Joe.
Dammit.
well that sucks
god damnit, way to piss away an easy baserunner
Dammit shoulda been a walk
I swear Joe Buck just said he popped up before he made contact
Man, I will never tire of hearing announcers fawn over Baez.
I'm hungry for SOLER POWER!
It's alright Javy. 
Ugh, nothing I hate more than a pop up on a full count, that look inside too
Tell me more about the challenge.

Ok ..how many times will Larry King take a piss tonight. The over/under is 2.5
At 82? I'll say 4 maybe 5.
Need to start manufacturing some runs
lolol Hill
Rizzo did have 17 steals last year. He will go.
Pitch the ball dude.
Please throw the ball away in an attempt to get Rizzo. By all means. 
I think Rich Hill is confusing Rizzo with Ricky Henderson 
SHUT UP JOE!
He scared!
Rizzo has to be asking Hyde, "What the fuck did I do to Hill?"

Rizzo isn't going anywhere

WOWOWOWOWOSOSLSOWOWOW
you're not getting anywhere

Yah Rizz!!
Good AB, Georgie!
I love Rizzo so much.
Soler and Javy with back to back 3-2 counts in the NLCS. Who would've thought.
You act like Soler doesn't walk...
At one point that curve in the dirt would've struck him out all the time.
lmao 
Let's pop this blister boys
WORK
Bahahahah! Atta boy Rizz.
I approve of Sloer's AB.
I THOUGHT HE WAS ABOUT TO CALL STRIKE THERE
Make him pitch.
Make that pitch count go up!!  The second time around will be good
Alright Addy time to do something.
Addi please work a count.
Good time for a Russel bomb here
Joe Buck, go fuck yourself. Rizzo pumps swipes.
Oh yeah, remember guys, we're "STEALING SIGNS" lololol.
Im liking the way this inning is going. Hill looks nervous 
He always looks nervous.
Oh man, fucking with em so hard.
Rizzo is rustling Hill's jimmies lol. 
Where did ball 1 miss there? See it goes both ways. 
Are we getting to Hill?
Pitch going so high. Loving it. Cmon russel bring em home
Addi will make it happen!!!!!!!!
well hes gonna be at 40 pitches at least, thats good 
No mention by Buck of stealing signs?

Oh god oh god oh god
Free upgrade thanks Delta SkyMiles.
We are getting HUGE breaks here right now
Alright, boyos, let's make something happen here.
Work them bases boys. 
Sick now hill is crossing up his catcher. He is all fucked up.
Did our sighs stealing cause that wild pitch Grandal?
that ball got passed him cus stealing signs
Addy is struggling so hard
Maybe Rizzo was stealing signs and Grandal got worried!
Get these two in baby
Please god let us score
god damn it

Because Buck is a moron. 
They're straight up dumb.
There goes that AB.
Fuuuuuuuuck man, can we just get on base at least?
Gotta get on base there
well shit.
Over-under on when they pull Hill?? I say 6th inning
Why so early? Not like our guys are doing anything. We have 1 hit.
True, but he looks like dogshit and seems like a nervous wreck, maybe that's ...
At this rate, 8th. 
Poop dicks.
GAWWHHHHHHH!!!!
Well the cubs are winning at pop ups.
Baez getting under it twice now. Hoping the move to 5 isn't changing his swing.
Omfg our offense needs to get their head out of their ass. This is pathetic.
So many fucking popups.
Make them pay for the second chance, Soler.
We need someone new out there
That is nonsense. Nonsense.
fuckkkkkkkkkkkkkk
Not a bad scoop, Jorge 
Gonzalez is pretty fucking good.
Dodgers have some of the weirdest looking players I swear
We're spoiled with our GQ team. 
Weirder than Hunter Pence?
JA off speed  stuff looking good

I think he might have come off
He came off the bag
He didn't actually keep the tag on
to be fair JA is pitching good! 

God damn, baez.....
Can't blame Javy for that.
Still frustrating.
God damn pederson sucks
I don't like that guy
He's off the bag
Tag wasn't on when Reddicks hand came off the bag

So dirty, like..Fuck.
put in papa already
Who?
Papa

Brooooooooo
Yikes.

Time to jump on it!
Just random noise should give us a good inning at some point.
Thanks Benny
Let's git some hits boys.

That first pitch for Bryant was not a strike.  Makes it hard to do anything. 
Yet he got on base.  It's baseball.  It happens.  Man up and get a fucking hit.

That's something.  Now build on it.
At least Bryant came to play
This is just sad man

KB is the only batter we can count on to be consistent. Sad. 
COME ON RIZZO. HIT A FUCKING HOME RUN
Try not to suck
This has to be like historically bad
Please leave that curve up to Rizzo again. 
Come on Fizz we need it here
Wonderful.  Just wonderful.
Yo.....what the fuck is going on....
Yuck
Rich "Clayton Bumgartner Kershaw" Hill
Welp... that's great.
It's hard not to be sad rn
9 outs to work with to get 3 runs, plenty of time! 
4
Spoke too soon
Welp
Bad and not getting better.
Yuck, like it fucking matters...
fuck me
That would happen, wouldn't it. 
This is bad......
:(
Man...where is Jake :'(
Please kill me. How is Rich Hill shitting all over us?
Welp. There's only so much misery I can take. 
gonna hide in my room in the dark and lock the door.
Lol, so happy I'm going to the game tomorrow..

He's pitching.
Well 4 runs isn't good but he's not getting run support so idk
True, it's not like 2 homers just came off his pitches.
Isn't even going to matter 
I should be used to this by now 
that'll do.
That'll do it
We can't hit lefties for shit for some reason 
They have everything on their side right now
This is the absolute most upsetting case.

Blanton? Fuck, if we can't capitalize the shit outta this....
Blanton is actually damn good 
Good contact at least 
And now that is just plain shit luck.
These guys dont have to move at all. 
Hopefully we can hit better off a "regular" throwing pitcher.

It was over a long time ago.

That summed it up nicely

Ooh, I know, I know. Me!!!

Hahaha :( 🍻🍺
Yay!!!!!
That's was one of the worst at bats I've ever seen.
Holy fucking shit Heyward. That was some pathetic ass batting.
Anyone got the dugout number? I've got a call for Joe. 
Game 4:
